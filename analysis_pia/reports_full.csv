2014-01-02,,hurt:2,,"SAN PEDRO, Laguna, Philippines  A passenger bus bound for Batangas and a softdrink delivery truck figured in a road accident along the South Luzon expressway (SLEx) in Laguna early on Thursday, leaving two persons injured. At past 10 a.m., traffic personnel were still retrieving the delivery truck of RC Cola that swerved and fell into the road embankment, said SLEx traffic and security manager Chito Silbol, in a phone interview. The delivery trucks driver and helper, whose names were not immediately available, were both injured in the accident, he said. Silbol said a unit of the Alps Bus Inc. hit the delivery truck at its rear at around 7:20 a.m. as the two vehicles were nearing the Silangan exit in Calamba City. The impact caused the truck to swerve and fall into the embankment. The police Highway Patrol Group in Laguna was still investigating the cause of the collision, but Silbol said one of the bus passengers told responders that the bus driver seemed sleepy behind the wheel, Silbol said.

Neri Javier Colmenares at Carlos Isagani Zarate, ang naturang uri ng headlights ay pinagmumulan ng disgrasya sa kalye dahil nakakasilaw sa mga kasalubong na sasakyan. ""Many countries have prohibited or regulated the use of these headlamps precisely in response to the threat to road safety posed by its use,"" pahayag ni Colmenares sa inihaing House Bill No. 2616, o ""An Act Prohibiting the Use of High Intensity Discharge (HID) Headlamps.""

2014-01-03,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesIts time to clean up the bureaucracy, and one agency that needs to go is the Road Board, which serves as just another unnecessary layer in the process of using the taxes collected from motorists to make roads safer and better, said Valenzuela Rep. Sherwin Gatchalian. Gatchalian has revived the idea of abolishing the Road Board, saying the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) and Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) could very well handle the use of the funds from the motor vehicle users charge (MVUC), or the road users tax. The Road Board is in charge of overseeing the use of the MVUC to maintain and improve roads, make them safer, and lessen air pollution. The board is headed by the DPWH secretary as ex-officio head, while the heads of the DOTC and the budget and finance departments serve as ex-officio members. Its three other members are officials from transport and motorists organizations. There have been earlier proposals to abolish the Road Board amid allegations of irregularities, such as using the road users tax for nonpriority or nonrelated projects. These proposals have gone nowhere, however. Gatchalian, in the bill he filed in late December, said the use of the MVUC for various road improvement projects could still continue. It is just the Road Board that needs to go, he said. He argued that since the DPWH and the DOTC are the ones handling the funds from the MVUC, it would be appropriate and practical to delegate the function of the laws implementation to the agencies which are its primary implementers. This way, a layer of the bureaucracy is removed, making the system efficient and prompt in its service to the people, he said. The Gatchalian bill seeks to direct the DPWH and DOTC secretaries to come up with new implementing rules and regulations for the collection and disbursement of the road users tax. It also prohibits the two department heads from creating another secretariat to oversee the funds use. Gatchalian said a streamlined bureaucracy is an important component of the Aquino administration program to improve the economy. The thrust of our government is to scrap nonessential and redundant programs and services for reallocation to much-needed infrastructure projects, and for augmentation of the health and social services program of the President that will benefit our people, for an all-inclusive growth, he said.",Leila B.

2014-01-04,,injured:2,,"A boom truck emerged from the SRP Tunnel in Cebu City at high speed and crashed into the rear of a Sports Utility Vehicle, triggering a six-vehicle smashup past 4 p.m. yesterday. The collision injured the driver of the Toyoto Revo and a married couple on board. It could have been worse as the impact had a domino effect on several north-bound vehicles on the South Osmena Road exit. The couple, 58-year-old Henson Go and his wife Norma, were rushed to Chong Hua Hospital with their driver, Pedro Dublin of barangay Subangdaku, Mandaue City. Initial reports said their injuries were minor. Henson was sitting beside the driver while his wife was in the back seat. The accident took place as rush hour traffic was building up. The Rosch-7 truck with four men on board belonged to a private contractor of the Visayan Electric Company (Veco). It came from Talisay city after installing a high voltage transformer. Traffic aide Hector Arcenal said the truck driver was speeding on his way out of the tunnel heading to Cebu City and that he misjudged the traffic ahead where cars had slowed down for a stop light on South Osmea Road exit. Padung siya saka unya kusog kaayo ang dagan. Wala to siya nag-anticipate. Ga-tuo siyag lahos-lahos, he said. (The driver was heading upward and going at high speed. He didnt anticipate that cars ahead. He though it was straight-through traffic.) The contractors truck first rammed the rear bumper of the Toyota Revo with plate number GPY-418. This pushed the SUV forward to hit a black Mitsubishi Strada pickup . The force caused the pickups back portion to rear up in the air and land on the front hood of the red and silver Toyota Revo. Further ahead, the pickup also rearended a Kia Spectra which crashed into a Mitsubishi L300 Van that later struck a multicab. Lineman Rustom Antonio, 29, said their team of four in the Rosch -7 truck was heading back to the office in Talamban, Cebu City to call it a day when the mishap occurred. The driver Parcial Gildardo, 53, was missing right after the collision when paramedics and police rushed to the crash site. Gildardo later showed up at the Citom office, where he said he went to get help. PO3 Welfredo Caperida, traffic investigator, said the truck drivers license would be confiscated by the Land Transportation Office (LTO) pending investigation. Its up to the parties whether they would file a criminal complaint, he said. He said car owners involved would file damage reports and the police would wait to see if a settlement would be reached for insurance claims to cover the cost of damage. PO3 Caperida said yesterdays accident was a case of overspeeding. He said drivers should always adopt defensive driving to avoid accidents and be conscious of traffic conditions and vehicles around them.

2014-01-04,,,,"The Quezon City council has enacted a measure against operators of private emission testing centers (PETCs) that issue clearances to vehicles without actually testing or even seeing them. PETCs are shops accredited by Land Transportation Office (LTO), which requires vehicles to undergo smoke emission tests and check if they meet environmental standards before their registration papers can be renewed. The LTO also requires it for imported or reconfigured vehicles. Unscrupulous PETCs have been issuing certificates of emission compliance, or CETCs, despite the non-appearance of the concerned vehicles, according to the council, which noted that this racket had been on the rise since 2010. They face fines ranging from P3,000 to P5,000 or can have their business permits revoked under the recently passed PETC Regulation Ordinance, which now awaits the signature of Mayor Herbert Bautista. The ordinance is silent, however, on what awaits vehicle owners caught taking advantage of the scheme. The council said the practice could be blamed for the continued proliferation of smoke-belching vehicles in the city, stressing that the ordinance was necessary to ensure honest-to-goodness emission tests and strict compliance with the Clean Air Act of 1999. All new and existing PETCs within the territorial jurisdiction of Quezon City shall be strictly monitored and inspected by the city governments business permit and licensing office (BPLO) and the environmental protection and waste management division (EPWMD), the ordinance said. All local PETCs will also be required to submit their authorization and accreditation papers from the transportation and trade departments when they apply for or renew their business permits at the BPLO. The EPWMD is ordered to ensure that PETCs in the city have testing lanes, employ emission control technicians certified by the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (Tesda), and are compliant with testing and calibration standards.",Jeannette I.

Instead, the motorists who figured in the collision reached a temporary agreement to file damage reports with Rosch-7, the private contractor that employs 53-year-old truck driver Gildardo Barcial (not Parcial Gildardo as r reported here earlier). Welfredo Caperida, investigator of the Cebu City Integrated Traffic Operations Management (Citom), said the motorists met with a representative of Rosch-7, a contractor of the Visayan Electric Co. (Veco), at the Citom office an hour after the accident which took place at 4 p.m. Ipa-estimate usa ilang damage, unya ug naa na sa ila, ilahang ihatag sa Rosch-7, (The victims involved were told to submit to Rosch-7 the cost of damage they sustained, Caperida said. Since no complaint was filed, Barcial was not detained. A settlement may be finalized tomorrow, Caperida said. Among those who attended the meeting was the lawyer of 58-year-old Henson Go and his wife Norma, who were passengers in the Toyota Revo van that was hit in the rear by Barcials boom truck. The couple were confined at Chong Hua Hospital for injuries. Their driver, Pedro Dublin of barangay Subangdaku, Mandaue City was moved to the St. Vincent General Hospital at Osmea Boulevard, Cebu City.

2014-02-23,,,,"If the Edsa Revolution were to happen today, People Power might temptingly include a side trip to the mall. The loyalist Gen. Fabian Ver would have a hard time looking for open fields to deploy tanks but could put snipers up on the billboards, and the defecting Lt. Gen. Fidel V. Ramos would still make his famous victory jumpthough with fewer people to see him, thanks to the elevated railway blocking the view. The MRT alone would make then Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile think twice about crossing over from Camp Aguinaldo to Camp Crame. With todays traffic jams, Vers tanks and armored personnel carriers would not have gotten far. Stretching for about 24 kilometers, the countrys busiest highway has since gotten busier, brighter, though in some parts blighted. Long gone are the days when a drive through Edsa offered a mostly low-rise, green and breezy vista which, thankfully back in 1986, made for sweeping, panoramic shots of mass upheaval, uncluttered by a giant Anne Curtis or fried chicken ad. If Edsa itself can be considered a monument to the revolution, then its transformation for the last 28 yearsprogress to some, poor urban planning to othersfittingly reflects the very hallmarks of the uprising: the spontaneity, the fiesta spirit, the patchwork of diverse faces and forces. To paraphrase a Counting Crows song, we have paved historic ground and put up a parking lotand much, much more: The Metro Rail Transit (MRT): It was opened in December 1999 during the short-lived presidency of Joseph Estrada, which two years later became the casualty of the second Edsa Revolution. The single biggest mass transport project on the highway in the post-Marcos years, the MRT is under growing pressure to expand and cope with the swelling passenger volume. A commuter revolution is waiting to happen there each morning. Flyovers: Imagine the Edsa gridlock at the intersections without them; four are in use today and also provide some of the U-turn slots on the highway. Malls, malls, malls: Construction of SM Megamall, for example, started in 1989 or just three years after the revolution. Occupying 21 hectares, the Henry Sy retail complex opened in mid-1991. The neighboring Robinsons Galleria of the Gokongweis opened a year earlier, its website proudly describing it as a famous Edsa Revolution landmark. Giant outdoor ads: There were already prominent outdoor ads on Edsa in the mid-1980s but they mostly had neon light displays and were few and far between, unlike todays ubiquitous towers of steel and tarpaulin that tend to be eyesores rather than enticements. High-rise condominiums: Some cashing in on the MRT stations and the need for minimal home-to-work travel time, these developments stick out of the horizon, dwarfing neighboring buildingsand possibly the local governments will to uphold zoning laws. The Number Coding Scheme: Not all major changes on Edsa are about structures. Implemented across Metro Manila but enforced most especially on Edsa during rush-hours, the scheme bans a vehicle from the road on a weekday depending on the last digit of the plate number. Its earlier version, the Odd-Even scheme, was introduced in 1991 by then Transportation Secretary Oscar Orbos. Yellow lanes for buses: Another Orbos idea still drawing the line to this day. Blue lanes for motorcycles: Introduced on Valentines Day in 2012 by the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) under chair Francis Tolentino, in response to the alarming number of accidents involving motorbikes. Murals: Amid the noise and fumes, public art is making an assertion. The one at the Cubao underpass, finished in 2012, is a joint project of the MMDA and the paint company Boysen, and conveys the urbanite vision of Finnish architect and filmmaker Tapio Snellman. An earlier project, a mural by Jose Tence Ruiz, features Nature images on the white walls of San Lorenzo Village, Makati City. Journey to Peace on Edsa: Deserving of a separate mention is the mural completed in 2013 on the walls of Camp Aguinaldo, a People Power site. Journey to Peace on Edsa depicts historic milestones and peace-building initiatives of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), including symbols and scenes from the 1986 Revolution. The collaborative work stretches for about 3,700 meters around the camp, with AG Sano as its lead artist. Techie traffic monitors: Launched in May 2013, the MMDAs Traffic Mirror project provides live online video feeds from closed-circuit television cameras (CCTVs) installed along the highway. The covered sections include Orense, Ayala, White Plains, P. Tuazon, Nepa Q-Mart and Megamall. Other electronic improvements on the highway are the LED signboards and timed traffic signal systems. Vertical gardens: A welcome touch of greenery in the underpasses. An agreement reached last year between the MMDA and outdoor advertising organizations will soon require the latter to allot space for or incorporate vertical gardens in the design of their billboards. Reblocking: The word has entered street lingo, quite literally, in recent years, basically referring to the governments public works projects removing old road pavement and laying fresh concrete. Dreaded as a cause of massive traffic jams, the practice often raises questions especially if the stretch of road set to be repaired still looks perfectly fine. It continues to ruin many weekend drives on Edsa. Our Lady of Edsa Shrine: It is said that the idea to put up a shrine at the corner of Edsa and Ortigas Avenue to commemorate the revolution came from one of its key figures, the late Jaime Cardinal Sin, according to edsashrine.com. The Cardinal was riding in the car together with Bishop Gabriel Reyes, then Auxiliary Bishop of Manila, en route to Camp Aguinaldo where they were to celebrate a Thanksgiving Mass. They came upon the intersectionand Bishop Reyes pointed it out to the Cardinal as the spot where intrepid but gentle nuns and young men and women stood in front of the tanks and offered flowers to the soldiers. Before the shrine was built, the area was just an empty lot with two huge billboards of the Family Rosary Crusade, featuring the image of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the slogans, The family that prays together stays together and A world at prayer is a world at peace. Forming the apex of the structure is the Marian bronze statue by the late artist Virginia Ty-Navarro.

2014-07-31,,,"Vehicle users, Public officials","MANILA, Philippines - Quezon City Mayor Herbert Bautista will review an ordinance requiring motorcycle riders in the city to wear vests printed with the plate number of their motorcycles. We will have it reviewed by the city legal department upon receipt of the copy of the measure, Bautista said in a text message to The STAR. City administrator Aldrin Cua said the city council  which passed the measure on third and final reading last week  has yet to transmit a copy of the ordinance to the mayors office. Hundreds of motorcycle riders yesterday staged a protest urging Bautista to veto the ordinance. The revised charter of Quezon City, as amended by Republic Act 5441, said an approved ordinance shall be deemed approved if the mayor fails to return it to the city council with his approval or veto within 10 days upon receipt of the transmittal. Second district Councilor Ranulfo Ludovica, principal author of the measure, earlier expressed hope that Bautista will approve the measure. Under the ordinance, the city will only require vests for motorcycle riders with passengers and not for a lone bike rider. Ludovica said this compromise was reached with bike riders who attended the public hearing. Once enacted, bike riders will be required to have vests showing the plate numbers of their motorcycles. The size of each letter or number will have to be six inches in height and one inch in width. Motorcycle-riding criminal elements have been blamed for robbery, kidnapping, carjacking, assassination and other crimes in the city. The council said displaying the plate number of motorcycles will help the police and other law enforcers in identifying the driver and its passenger. It added that non-wearing of the prescribed vest with the plate number will promptly call the attention of the police and the public. There is a need to thwart the nefarious activities of motorcycle-riding criminals to protect the citizens and to ensure public safety and order, read the ordinance. The city council passed the ordinance following a shooting rampage in Fairview last May that left four people dead. Violators will face fines of P1,000 to P5,000. The mayors office is tasked to issue the implementing rules and regulations of the measure. A 60-day phasing period will be implemented once the ordinance takes effect.",,"By Janvic Mateo, The Philippine Star",City official,yes,2014-07-31 00:00:00,formulation of legislationlocal ordinances,,,,,,,,english,,http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/07/30/14/bistek-review-plakavest-ordinance-quezon-city,,"quezon city, quezon",text,,487.0,,2376.0,,candice,,,policy and legislation,5.0,Straight News,,,,,,abs-cbnnews,no,no,,,,Bistek to review 'plakavest' ordinance in Quezon City,Neutral,,

2014-01-07,,,,"MANILA - How much did Don Mariano Bus Transit give in financial assistance to passengers of a off the Skyway last December 16? Don Mariano representatives said the company has released P6 million in assistance to victims of the tragedy. Families of those who perished from the accident were given P65,000 in burial assistance. Those who survived and were released from the hospital received P40,000 while those still in the hospital are being provided assistance in their hospital bills. The bus company is asking the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board to allow their company to resume operations following the tragedy. Families of the victims opposed the appeal, saying they are not receiving enough assistance from the company. Passenger Dionisio Tasara is one of those still in the hospital. He injured his spine and is currently unable to move his waist and legs. He underwent three major operations and will have to undergo another one soon. Doctors said it might take a year or more for Tasara to recover. They are also not sure if he will be able to walk again. His wife, Rosalita, said they need more than just payment for hospital bills since they have no source of income. She said Dionisio might not be able to work again for a long time, if ever. The LTFRB meanwhile is set to decide on the permanent cancellation of the Don Mariano franchise in two weeks. A witness earlier said the Don Mariano bus was clearly before it fell off the Skyway. Skyway management said the bus was speeding on a slippery portion of the road due to an earlier downpour. Officials said the were later on found to be already worn out.

2014-01-08,,,,"The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) launched on Wednesday a new traffic control system which will supposedly improve the monitoring and management of the traffic situation in Metro Manila. MMDA Chairman Francis Tolentino said the new Traffic Signal System (TSS), called ""Hermes"", will help improve the safety of pedestrians, commuters, and vehicles through ""well-coordinated"" signal routes. It can analyze and consolidate information for faster mobility, improved road safety, optimized vehicle flow and pedestrian movement, and reduced travel times, he said. During his speech at the launch of the project, President Benigno Aquino III said the new system will allow the MMDA to remotely control the traffic lights all over Metro Manila from its new Command and Control Center in Makati City. This will be made possible with the new system and the installation of 25 new fiber optic high defiinition Pan-Tilt-Zoom Traffic Control/Video surveillance cameras and 36 45-inch video screens that shall monitor activities. The MMDA said the system will initially be implemented in 85 priority intersections and 25 traffic control/video surveillance locations around Metro Manila. In the future, this new system will be able to manage up to 500 intersections. TSS aims to upgrade, automate, and optimize the management and traffic engineering installations around Metro Manila, said Tolentino.

2014-10-28,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesThe Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) remained unfazed by Mondays nationwide transport protest involving public utility jeepney (PUJ) drivers and operators opposed to a government order imposing steeper fines for traffic violations. However, the LTFRB is studying revisions to Joint Administrative Order (JAO) No. 2014-01which has come under attack from transport groupsincluding cutting the penalties for franchise violations by half. The protests by the Pagkakaisa ng Samahan ng Tsuper at Opereytor Nationwide (Piston) on Monday included a transport caravan in Metro Manila, which gathered around 350 drivers and operators and 30 PUJs coming from Monumento in Caloocan City, Novaliches and Cubao in Quezon City, and Baclaran in Paraaque City. The caravan ended in a rally outside the LTFRB office on East Avenue, Quezon City. The protesters challenged LTFRB Chair Winston Ginez to make good his earlier warning to cancel franchises of participants if the protest paralyzed public transport. Similar protests were held in other parts of the metro like Alabang in Muntinlupa City, Roxas Boulevard in Pasay City, and in provinces like Albay, Iloilo, Cebu, Surigao del Norte and General Santos City and Davao City. In Cagayan de Oro City, the transport strike led by the Solidarity of Transport Alliance in Northern Mindanao-Pinagkaisang Samahan ng mga Tsuper at Operator Nationwide (Starex-Piston) crippled several areas, leaving hundreds of passengers stranded Monday morning. Senior Supt. Faro Antonio Olaguera, Cagayan de Oro police chief, said there was 80 percent transport paralysisin the western part of the city. The Piston rallies sought to dramatize the groups opposition to the JAO, implemented in June, which imposed higher fines on public utility vehicles operating without or outside of their franchises: as high as P1 million for buses; P200,000 for trucks; P50,000 for jeepneys; P200,000 for vans; P120,000 for sedans; and P6,000 for motorcycles. Piston national president George San Mateo said the protests were designed to catch the attention of the Supreme Court to expedite the hearing of a pending petition by transport groups to stop the implementation of the JAO and have it declared as unconstitutional. San Mateo said the protests were triumphant in gathering the support of the transport sector, with some PUJ drivers and operators in Metro Manila volunteering to go on strike. In our caravan, we noticed that PUJs plying the Paraaque area decreased by 98 percent, those in the Monumento area by around 70 percent, and those in Alabang by 85 percent, San Mateo said. He said a strike declared by Piston members in northern Mindanao was also able to paralyze public transport in the region by 90 percent. However, Ginez said the LTFRB field offices reported no transport paralysis in Metro Manila or the provinces. Ginez said the protest actions yielded minimal inconvenience even as the issues raised by Piston were already discussed during public consultations, which had already been noted. The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) said traffic was manageable on Monday in areas where Piston held its transport strike.

The TSS is capable of managing traffic signals at 85 key intersections in the metropolis, the MMDA said. The Metrobase can also monitor road activities using video feeds from 25 high definition cameras installed in 25 key locations in Metro Manila. Earlier, MMDA Chairman Francis Tolentino said a bulk of its P2.65-billion budget for 2014 would be used for the installation of 161 traffic signal lights and systems in the metropolis as well as for the purchase of flood control equipment. Tolentino said Metro Manila has a total of 421 traffic signal lights and many of them will have to be replaced as part of a traffic master plan. He said that when it rains, some of the traffic lights malfunction and cause traffic jams. Some of the traffic lights were put up in 1976, the MMDA chief said. He said the replacement of the traffic lights will cost P399 million. Tolentino said that some of the new traffic lights, especially those at strategic intersections, will use light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and be fitted with closed-circuit television cameras before they are hooked up to a monitoring center at the MMDAs headquarters.",,"By Mike Frialde, The Philippine Star",Metropolitan Manila Development Authority,yes,2014-01-08 00:00:00,traffic management technology,,,,,,,,english,,http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/01/08/14/mmda-unveils-high-tech-metrobase-today,,"makati, metro manila, manila",text,,804.0,,945.0,,pia,,,traffic congestion,4.5,Straight News,,,,,,abs-cbnnews,no,,,,,MMDA unveils high-tech Metrobase today,,,

2014-01-10,,,,"The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) has launched a P295-million digital traffic signal system, one that can automatically calculate vehicular volume and tell which lane in an intersection needs more green-light time. Under the first phase of the upgrade, 85 traffic signals and controllers, along with 25 high-definition closed circuit television cameras (CCTVs) were installed at priority intersections in the metropolis, all linked to the MMDA command and control center in Guadalupe, Makati City. During the launch on Wednesday, Indra account manager Jonathan Aguirre explained that the old system is based on a fixed timer. You cannot change it even if the traffic volume is low. Now, the automatic mode of operation allows more green (light) time in the direction that needs it most. And it can actually be changed (at the MMDA), without having to go to the intersection, Aguirre said. Indra project manager Carl Decloedt added that the new system takes real-time data from the streets [through] loop detectors on the ground. The sensors process the vehicle count and computes the traffic volume on-site and in real time. Based on that, the system calculates what the best timing is for the traffic lights, Decloedt said. President Aquino, the guest of honor, noted that Metro Manila had been stuck with traffic management technologies as old as 14 years. Most equipment, like controllers for the more than 400 intersections, have been used to the fullest and need to be replaced. This doesnt even include the failing traffic lights and loop detectors that, instead of being instruments of order and safety, are sometimes even the cause of accidents, Mr. Aquino said. As of 2013, he said, there are two million registered cars in the capital, with the heavy traffic resulting in lost work hours and income worth P2.5 billion every day. Aquino hoped the new system would provide a quicker and more accurate response to Metro Manilas notorious traffic jams and also be useful as a tool for security and public safety, referring to the CCTVs. The President, who early in his term imposed the no wang-wang policy on his own motor pool by not using vehicle sirens just to force his way through heavy traffic, said the new technology should be complemented with discipline among motorists. I hope we develop discipline. Even if sometimes we are tempted as we lose our temper or get bored on the road, let us not make it an excuse for breaking the law, he said before an audience that included several Metro Manila mayors. No one has the license to behave with that wang-wang mentality or act like a king on the road, the President said.",Jaymee T.

2014-01-10,,,,"A group of bus operators on Friday asked the high court to assign someone to inspect the Southwest Interim Transport Terminal (SITT) at the Uniwide Coastal Mall in Paraaque.  In a petition, bus operators Angeles Bayot, Miriam Villena, Nila Santos, Angela Legaspi, Orlando Ocampo, Basilia Crutyo and Diosdado Perillo said the SITT should now be inspected after reportedly getting a go signal from the Metro Manila Development Authority.  There being no more contest or objection to the motion for ocular inspection, the Supreme Court may now designate an officer of the court or a Commissioner to conduct the said ocular inspection for at least three days and at different hours of the day, said the petitioners through their legal counsel Romulo Macalintal.  The group said the inspection will help the high tribunal determine if the transport terminal and operations there are at par with international standards.  Macalintal said the inspection would ""expose the dismal condition of its premises where the riding public, bus drivers, and bus conductors are hazardously exposed to air pollution and heavy traffic because of the continuous running of the diesel engines of many buses waiting for about two hours for their turn to enter the SITT terminal.""  He said the space occupied by the SITT at the Uniwide Coastal Mall was designed for light vehicles and not big buses.  Macalintal also said the creation of the SITT caused the arbitrary amendment of petitioners' Certificates of Public Convenience (CPCs) without notice and hearing, which he said was in violation of Commonwealth Act No. 146 or the Public Service Act.  The Public Service Act requires the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTRB) to give franchise holders proper notice and hearing before amending, modifying or revoking any CPC.  Macalintal said that while his clients acknowledged the SITT's goal of decongesting traffic along Epifanio de los Santos Avenue, the new transport system should not affect buses that do not travel along EDSA in the first place.  Macalintal said his clients' bus units originally travelled from Cavite to Manila, but routes had to be cut short at Paraaque, where the SITT is located.  In a petition filed in December, the group of transport operators said instead of an integrated system, the LTFRB created an isolated or interim system.  The commuters are exposed to too much pollution brought about by the continuous emission of polluted air from the diesel engines of the hundreds of buses waiting in queue to load their passengers, it added.  The controversial transport policy prevents provincial public utility buses coming from the south from going beyond Paraaque. Buses using the Coastal Road or Manila-Cavite Expressway are barred from entering Metro Manila beyond Paraaque City.  These buses are required to end their routes at the Southwest Interim Transport Terminal at the Uniwide Coastal Mall in Baclaran, Paraaque City. Commuters have to transfer to city buses or other public utility vehicles operating within the city.  The new integrated transport system was established through Executive Order No. 67, issued by President Benigno Aquino III, which paved the way for the creation of an Integrated Transport System (ITS).  Meanwhile, Administrative Order No. 40 created ""Interim Transport Terminals"" in preparation for the ITS, and was also issued by the President.  The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) also issued Memorandum Circular No. 2013-004 which amended the route of provincial buses coming from provinces south of Metro Manila.

Despite the increase in electricity rates, it will still be a cheaper alternative to diesel-powered vehicles.  Kino-compute namin ito na 400 to 500 lang ang charge natin as compared to yung mga diesel. Ang ginagastos nila is 1,000 to 1,200 a day, pareho lang ang distansyang tatakbuhin natin, Dy said.  It takes five hours for the COMET's battery to fully charge using 220 volts of electricity. It also features WiFi connection, a flatscreen TV, and a security camera.  Its air suspension technology allows the vehicle's body to slowly descend in order to allow persons with disabilities to go on board and off board easily. It can also go through floods during rainy seasons.  A prepaid card will be used to pay for transportation fees which are the same as that of ordinary jeeps.

2014-01-10,,,"Transport sector leaders, Transport sector workers","MANILA -- The daughter of a man who was hit by a taxi driver is calling for justice after the latter just left her father dying at a parking lot of a hospital in Quezon City. Speaking to radio dzMM on Friday, Eleonor Ong recounted how her father was brought to the Quezon City General Hospital (QCGH) after the incident but was left alone fighting for his life at the parking lot. Ong, citing witnesses, said her father, who was on board a bicycle, was on his way home one night last week when he was suddenly hit by a taxi in Fairview. She said the taxi driver then tried to run away and leave her wounded father on the road. Fortunately, a tricycle driver, who witnessed the incident and later told her what happened, immediately prevented the taxi driver from running away. ""Paglingon niya (tricycle driver) po, nakita niya yung tatay ko tumitilapon na po. Tapos po yung taxi driver tatakas pa. Ang ginawa po ng tricycle driver nag-counterflow po siya, hinarang niya po yung tricycle sa harap ng taxi,"" Ong said. ""Tapos bumaba po siya, inutusan niya yung taxi driver na dalhin sa ospital yung father ko,"" she added. Upon prodding, the taxi driver eventually requested his female passenger to get off the vehicle then lifted Ong's father and boarded him in the taxi. The victim was still alive when he was lifted by the taxi driver, said Ong, citing people who witnessed the incident. As soon as her father was boarded in the taxi, she said the driver went straight to QCGH in Barangay Bahay Toro when he could have instead brought the victim to a nearer hospital such as the Far Eastern University Hospital, General Malvar Hospital, New Era General Hospital, or East Avenue Medical Center. Upon arriving at QCGH, Ong said the driver did not even bring her father to the hospital's emergency room but instead just abandoned him inside the taxi. ""Instead na dalhin niya sa ER para matingnan, iniwanan niya po sa parking lot ng QCGH, sa madilim na parte pa po. At tumakas,"" Ong said, painfully noting that her father could have survived if only he was immediately given treatment. The Mama taxi with plate number TWS 729 was later found by police authorities at the hospital's parking lot and impounded in Camp Karingal. When she went to Camp Karingal to follow up on the investigation into her father's case, Ong said she saw the operator of the taxi. The operator, however, did not approach her. ""Kahit nung nagpunta kami sa Camp Karinigal, tinitingnan lang po nila kami eh. Ni hindi man lang nga po nagsorry o nagcondolence sa amin,"" she said. The driver, who was later identified as Monrey Montenegro, was arrested by police in his house in Caloocan. Montenegro has already undergone inquest proceedings and was charged with reckless imprudence resulting to homicide, which is a bailable offense. Ong lamented that the driver should have been charged with a graver offense, noting how he just abandoned her injured father. ""Para sa amin, pwede pa pong mas mataas sana dun ang i-kaso sa kanya dahil iniwan niya yung father ko, hinayaan niyang mamatay sa parking lot sa QCGH,"" she said. Montenegro, for his part, claimed that the victim was already dead when he left him at the hospital's parking lot. ""Ang sabi niya patay na raw kasi kaya iniwan niya. Eh ang sabi ko nga po paano mo nalamang patay na eh hindi ka naman doktor para makapagsabi at walang tumingin na doktor,"" Ong said. Ong is now requesting the female passenger of Montenegro to surface and help shed light on the case. ""Kung sino ka man po, sana matulungan niyo yung father ko na mabigyan ng justice yung pagkamatay niya. Kayo lang po kasi yung nakakaalam ng tunay na nangyari aside po dun sa tricycle driver na nakakita. Malaki din ang maitutulong niyo sa kaso."" She also asked for the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board's (LTFRB) assistance in holding the operator of the taxi accountable for the incident and also possibly suspending the franchise of the taxi. LTFRB chairman Winston Ginez said they will set a hearing regarding the case. ""Ipapatawag namin sa imbestigasyon yung operator ng taxi at bibigyan ng pagkakataong makapagsalita. After ng imbestigasyon, magdedecide kung bibigyan ng fine o penalty, suspension, o cancellation of license.""

2014-01-14,,,Transport sector leaders,"MANILA - The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) cancelled the franchise of the Don Mariano Transit Corporation, which was involved in the Skyway crash on December 16 that killed 21 people. LTFRB Chairman Winston Ginez noted the many lapses and violations on the part of Don Marian Transit, which has 78 units. Immediately after the December 16 incident, the LTFRB preventively suspended Don Mariano's fleet for 30 days. ""With all the evidences submitted, gathered and discussed, there is no doubt that Don Mariano Transit Bus Corporation has repeatedly failed to comply with the terms and conditions of the [Certificates of Public Convenience] granted to it,"" he said. The bus firm claimed the unit involved in the fatal crash was roadworthy, but Ginez begged to disagree. Citing reports from the Land Transportation Office (LTO) and the Philippine National Police (PNP), he said six (6) tires (two in front, four at the rear) of the bus were already worn out and thus not safe in driving under bad climate condition. Ginez also cited the report of the PNP-Crime Laboratory Group that the chassis number (JALFVR34797000092) indicated on the registration records of said bus involved in the Skyway accident was not registered with the LTO. ""The fact that Don Mariano Bus Corp allowed the illegal use or change of chassis without informing the LTFRB or undergoing its procedural requirement at the LTO is a clear misrepresentation, to say the least, which this Board can never tolerate,"" Ginez said. ""Not only was the particular bus unit involved in the accident not roadworthy to be on the streets, but the bus company was remiss and blatantly negligent in the maintenance and repair of its bus units and in the performance of its business affairs and activities,"" he added. In fact, only six units of Don Marianos fleet passed a roadworthiness inspection, he said. ""As part of our regulatory powers, we will not hesitate to suspend the franchise of bus operators who fail to meet our strict requirements in terms of road worthiness of their whole fleet,"" Ginez warned.

2014-01-17,,,,"Is the new traffic control scheme yet another doomed initiative of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) at taxpayers expense? The project replicates the wasted investment of Makati a decade ago when hundreds of millions of taxpayer pesos were invested in a similar scheme with exactly the same objective. That projected improved traffic control system failed miserably. An assessment made by international analysts pointed to many factors for the systems failuresuch as the lack of commitment on the part of the authorities; a lack of understanding of the system on the part of the public; the lack of personnel to regulate the system; interference by uneducated traffic enforcers who overrode the system; and drivers, particularly jeepney drivers, who stopped within the monitored zone and who had no knowledge of driving regulations or understanding of the white demarcation lines indicating the points where the vehicles should stop or of the yellow box law in the middle of the intersection. (But where are the yellow boxes today?) Will another expensive project that will not be effected once payment has been made for it line more pockets? It has been proven elsewhere that such a scheme can only succeed if the same is backed up by extensive public education, trained and reliable enforcers and a technological infrastructure to monitor and control the citywide complex system. There is so much local and international experience to tap. Why the expensive trips abroad, at taxpayers expense, to confirm the lessons already learned overseas and right here over the last decade? If companies want to sell expertise and business in Manila, the business rules are simplelet them come here, at their expense, to explain the current technology and experiences. Why must the Philippine government fund an expensive trip to gather lessons that are openly available from international and local analyses of the past Makati experience, or that visiting suppliers of the new technology can teach? And does the MMDA have the determination to enforce its regulations through its own enforcers? With most traffic laws and its own regulations, the MMDA has miserably failed to show such determination to this day, so what hope is there with the new traffic light scheme? So many unenforced MMDA regulations and bungled projects. Will this be another one?

2014-01-17,,death:1,,"The death insurance benefit for public utility vehicle (PUV) passengers involved in accidents will double to P150,000 per person starting Feb. 1, according to the Insurance Commission. The Insurance Commission, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) and members of the insurance industry agreed to the 100-percent increase in the death benefit for PUV passengers, Insurance Commissioner Emmanuel Dooc said in a briefing Friday. The protection to be given to victims, particularly passengers of PUVs involved in accidents, will double starting next month, Dooc said. He said the insurance industry has sufficient resources to meet the hike in the benefit and service the potential claims. Because of the increase in the death benefit, PUV operators will need to deal with higher annual insurance premiums. The rate of increase in premiums will depend on the type of vehicle. Operators of provincial buses will pay the highest annual premium of P2,180. The regulators decided to increase the benefit after an accident involving a Don Mariano Transit bus occurred in December last year. The bus fell off the Skyway and hit a van, killing 20 passengers. Authorities reported that 11 other passengers were injured. UCPB General Insurance Co. Inc. is the lead insurer of Don Mariano. In the same briefing, UCPB senior vice president Edgardo Rosario said the beneficiaries of the passengers who died in the accident are each entitled to P75,000. The benefit is covered by the passenger personal accident insurance (PPAI), which all PUV operators are required to have. The PPAI also provides benefits for the bus driver and conductor such as assistance worth P10,000 for each of them, medical reimbursement insurance of up to P5,000 for each, a P5,000 educational assistance covering one child for each, a P5,000 subsidy for caskets for both, and P30,000 to cover legal expenses resulting from cases involving accidents. Meantime, Dooc denied that the insurance industry was slow in releasing the claims. He said UCPB General, upon instruction of the Insurance Commission, disbursed half of the amount of the death insurance benefits within three days of the accident. UCPBs Rosario said the first installment of the death insurance benefit was released to Don Mariano, which had direct contact with the passengers and their beneficiaries. Don Mariano has yet to release the insurance benefits to the families of passengers. But Rosario added that the bus operator already spent P8 million to compensate the victims and their families. The amount did not include the first installment of the benefits released by UCPB. Rosario said UCPB would get back the money from Don Mariano and would be the one to release the amount to the beneficiaries. He said families of the victims could get the claims two days after they filed the required documents. If a victim was single, the parents could claim the insurance benefit by submitting the victims birth certificate. If a victim happened to be married, the spouse could claim the insurance benefit by submitting their marriage certificate. Rosario said beneficiaries of most of the victims, except for six, have already been identified. They are advised to get in touch with UCPB General as soon as possible to submit their requirements and get their claims. The six victims whose beneficiaries remain unidentified are Rolando Valeros, Roberto Bautista, Rolly Borres, Ricardo Gonzales, Arvin Balurin and Russell Constantino. Beneficiaries of the six victims are advised to get in touch with UCBP General for identification and claims processing.",Michelle V.

2014-01-17,,,,"How defined must the traffic problem in Metro Manila be for us to see and understand it? What is the main mission objective of an operative of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA)? Isnt any one of them, by any chance, seeking practical, durable and commendable solutions to the perennial traffic problem in the metropolis? Or if solutions have been found, isnt any one of them enforcing them? Or am I wrong? The issue is not well understood or is it? What exactly are the relevant issues to an MMDA operative when he is on the road to perform his job? Isnt it to ensure free-flowing traffic on the road and to consistently, properly enforce safety traffic rules for the protection and welfare of all road users? If this is the case, then why are MMDA operatives more concerned about watching the traffic on high definition (HD) CCTV, a project that will entail the shelling out of a hefty amount of taxpayer money? I thought that after identifying the causes of the problem, the MMDA will find ways to solve them. Or maybe, our MMDA operatives are short-sighted they need a clearer picture to view obvious problems? Ok, our roads look clean, well-painted, with healthy plants growing along the sidewalks, etc. The question is, how effective, durable and practical is this HD investment that it has been given more priority than the overall core objectives of the MMDA? Yes, this may impress foreign visitors/tourists for a while, but let us not skip the real issues. These same visitors/tourists will use our major road networks to see the tourist sites around Metro Manila. So please answer the following questions: Why prioritize projects requiring the investment of lots of taxpayer money, such as beautification projects and/or enhancing traffic monitoring equipment over and above the training of personnel, better traffic road signs, safety equipment, quality roads? How exactly can the MMDA untangle traffic gridlocks with HD CCTVs? Again, I doubt it very much if any MMDA operative will be able to answer this question. MMDA Chair Francis Tolentino may also answer the question, if he doesnt mind. I am afraid I may be missing something because I myself cannot figure out an answer.

The report says that poor planning and funding delays by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) caused road projects costing P69.94 million to miss their completion dates in 2012. The Department of Transportation and Communications-Office of the Secretary was also held responsible for failing to implement three anti-pollution projects amounting to P45.88 million under the Special Vehicle Pollution Control Fund. Failed projects include repair work on major motorways between Camarines Sur and Albay amounting to P25 million, and a pilot testing program of alternative fuel sources for public transportation amounting to P33.4 million. Had the projects been completed with the target dates of completion, beneficiaries/end-users and commuters could have immediately benefited therefrom. This also resulted in huge amount of un-utilized and reverted funds which could have been programmed for other priority projects, COA said. On Friday, the audit commission also hit the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation, for its officials and employees between 2003 and 2004.

Province last Feb. 7 that left 14 people dead. The LTFRB has consulted the Office of the Solicitor General on the legal implications of the CA decision, and its chairman, Winston Ginez, said the OSG wants to seek the SCs guidance on the extent of the boards powers in cases wherein transport firms fail to exercise extraordinary diligence in protecting their passengers. In a recent order, the CA ordered the lifting of the suspension on the 186 buses of GV Florida Transport. The suspension started last March 11 and would have ended in September. The bus involved in the Bontoc mishap was bought by GV Florida from Dagupan Bus Co. and used a franchise that Mt. Province Cable Tours sold to the bus firm. The LTFRB earlier had ordered the six-month suspension of the 28 franchises of GV Florida  covering 186 buses  for its unauthorized purchase of the Mt. Province Cable Tours franchise and the unauthorized use of the bus registered to Dagupan Bus Co., which the board said were violations of the Public Service Code. The LTFRB also cancelled the franchise  covering 10 buses, including the ill-fated unit  that GV Florida bought from Mt. Province Cable Tours. The CA, however, said GV Florida was penalized for a non-existing violation. According to Ginez, the suspension of GV Florida would have been lifted only once all its drivers secure National Competency III certification from the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority and undergo compulsory drug testing; its conductors get licenses from the Land Transportation Office; and all its buses undergo roadworthiness inspection.",,"By Reinir Padua, The Philippine Star","LTFRB, Office of Solicitor General",yes,2014-07-06 00:00:00,ltfrb to appeal to the supreme court to overturn ca ruling,,,,,,,,english,yes,http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/07/06/14/ltfrb-question-ca-lifting-bus-firms-suspension-sc,,dagupan,text,#bontocbustragedy,57.0,,1050.0,,mavie,This report is part of an ongoing coverage of the Bontoc Bus Tragedy.

2014-01-23,,,,"Up to 13 road and mass transport projects in the capital are in the pipeline in the next two years, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) said Wednesday as it advised motorists and commuters to brace themselves for continued heavy traffic on major routes till 2016. In a meeting, the Metro Manila Regional Development Council (RDC)a body composed of the MMDA and the 17 mayors of Metro Manilaapproved the various projects proposed by the Department of Transportation and Communications (DoTC) and the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH). Speaking to reporters, MMDA Chair Francis Tolentino said the construction schedules of these projects might overlap and there will be a point when they will happen simultaneously. To prepare for this, the project proponents will meet again on the first week of February to draft a traffic management plan for the whole metro. Alternative routes and rerouting schemes will be discussed not just per project but based on their being interconnected, Tolentino added. In the morning session, DoTC representatives presented a plan to start constructing two transport stations in Taguig and Paraaque cities under the Integrated Terminal System starting in the fourth quarter of the year. Transportation officials also advised the body about the Light Rail Transit 1 North Extension Common Station that would connect the LRT 1 line and the Metro Rail Transit (MRT) in Quezon City. Work starts in July this year and is expected to be finished in September 2015. The DOTCs LRT 2 East Extension Project, which will extend the rail line along Marcos Highway from Santolan station to Sumulong Highway, is also expected to be constructed from November this year to June 2016. DPWH representatives, meanwhile, presented the center link project connecting Bonifacio Global City to Ortigas Center. Construction is expected to start in July this year. Phase I of the project will put a bridge over Pasig River between Sta. Monica Street in Pasig City to Lawton Avenue in Makati City. Phase II will run from Lawton to the BGC Viaduct, then from Shaw Boulevard to the Sta. Monica viaduct. The DPWH also presented for RDCs approval a four-lane underpass project on Gil Puyat Avenue (Buendia), which will pass through the intersections of Makati Avenue and Paseo de Roxas. The agency intends to start it this April. The public works department also discussed the proposed Edsa North-North Mindanao interchange and the Circumferential Road 3 (C3) project. Aside from these projects, Tolentino cited other roadworks ahead: Repairs on Pasay Road and Magallanes interchange; Construction of the Naia elevated expressway starting this quarter; Construction of the Edsa-Taft flyover in the last quarter Construction of the Skyway 3 from Makati to Quezon City, which was launched on Wednesday. Tolentino said the MMDA would most likely revive its so-called Christmas lanes much earlier than the holidays and require the project proponents to deploy their own traffic marshals to assist motorists. After these projects, expect traffic to ease up. No pain, no gain, he said. By the first quarter of 2016, we will see all these projects in action. President Aquino made a similar forecast in a speech during the launch of Skyway 3, which would run from Buendia, Makati City, to Balintawak, Quezon City. Mr. Aquino said the project would serve as an alternative highway linking southern and northern Luzon and reduce traffic volume on Edsa and other primary roads by about 55,000 vehicles daily. Building it would employ around 6,000 people and create related jobs or economic activities for at least 10,000 more, he said. The Metro Manila Skyway Stage 3 is led by San Miguel Corp. and Indonesias Citra Group. The latter was also behind the original Skyway project in the southern part of the capital. Proponents say the 14.8-km, six-lane elevated expressway can cut travel time from Buendia to Balintawak from an hour and a half to only about 15 minutes. It will start at the end of the existing Skyway Stage 1 on Buendia, run through the length of Osmea Highway, Quirino Avenue, Paco, Sta. Mesa via the Nagtahan flyovers, through Aurora Boulevard and Araneta Avenue up to Sgt. Rivera Road, and end at the bend of A Bonifacio Avenue toward North Luzon Expressway (NLEx). Completion is expected in April 2017, though SMC president Ramon Ang as well as Transportation Secretary Joseph Abaya said it could be finished a year ahead of schedule if right of way issues are immediately addressed. There is a proposed accelerated plan. Highly critical here is (the acquisition of) right of way, Abaya said after the program. If things fall into place and right of way is acquired without problems, then we can get it done by June 2016. Given the state of traffic in Metro Manila, both the public and private sector have been looking for ways to ease the gridlock and we believe that this project is a step in the right direction. The connector road will go a long way in helping solve our traffic problems, Ang said. We recognize the importance of good infrastructure in creating the conditions for a dynamic economy, Ang said. A job-creating economy needs good infrastructure and a good transport system. According to Citra, Stage 3 will help decongest not only Edsa but also C-5 Road and streets in central Manila. Another road project linking NLEx and South Luzon Expressway, which is being pursued by Metro Pacific Investments led by Manuel V. Pangilinan, starts construction in July this year and also targets completion in mid-2016.

2014-01-23,,,,"MANILA - Social media users react on the possible consequences commuters and motorists alike will have to get used to in the coming years following the announcement that main roads in Metro Manila will undergo rehabilitation starting this year. The Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) on Wednesday warned that the 2-year long project may cause traffic until it reaches completion by 2016. TV Patrol asked its social media followers if they are willing to endure traffic at EDSA, with the promise that the roads and traffic flow will improve. Netizens replied with mixed views. Some were appalled by the length of time DPWH needs to complete the project, while most said they were willing to wait as long as it will promise lesser traffic in EDSA. Chrizel Lozano said that road widening wouldn't be a problem if private motorists are willing to use public transport for the meantime. Hindi sana magiging problema ang road widening kung kaya naman mag-commute. Ang iba kasi, gamit lang ang sasakyan sa pamporma. Dagdag sikip lang tuloy sa kalsada. On a similar view, Felix de Barrio said that public transport should be likened to other countries, wherein they have trains that can accommodate huge numbers of passengers with no delay. Latagan ng riles yan at lagyan ng tren na mahaba, gaya sa Tokyo at New York. Michael Garcia believes that vehicle users should be more understanding of the situation as it will cause better traffic flow in Metro Manila. Dapat pang habaan ang pasensya at unawa kung ang kapalit naman nito ay maayos na kalsada. Giving credit to the government is Jose Leal, who said that he is glad that efforts are now felt through visible projects. Ayos lang at least nagtatrabaho ang gobyerno. Over on Twitter, Angeli Datoy agrees that it is alright to wait as long as those two years are used well. Lis Pilares said that re-routing schemes should be clearly planned out before DPWH starts the project. Recalling the period when the LRT-2 was still being constructed, Jernalie Dumapay said that there is no reason to be impatient about the time-frame, since waiting worked out well for commuters who now uses LRT-2. Like most users who replied positively about the situation, Marianne Barrios said that it is alright to endure the effects of the road project, as long as there will be no more traffic in EDSA by 2016.",,"by Fidea Encarnacion, ABS-CBNnews.com",,yes,2014-01-23 00:00:00,"road infrastructure repair,maintenance,reports on traffic congestion",,,,,,,,english,,http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/01/23/14/netizens-willing-endure-traffic-road-projects,,"metro manila, manila",text,,728.0,,2379.0,,pia,,,"vehicle safety and maintenance, road infrastructure, traffic congestion",4.5,-,,,,,,abs-cbnnews,no,,,,,Netizens willing to endure traffic for road projects,,,

Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) Chair Francis Tolentino on Friday asked the riding public to adopt what he called the Roadways Construction Lifestyle Adjustment. Tolentino said Metro Manila residents should consider limiting their trips to within their respective localities to minimize vehicular and pedestrian volume on the roads. If youre a Pasay City resident, dont go to Quezon City just to watch movies. We should plan our trips ahead so as not to contribute to traffic congestion and also for our own convenience, Tolentino said in a statement. Tolentino also suggested that private companies, especially those along the route of construction projects, implement flexitime working hours for their employees. This is a construction of massive proportions that would last 32 months, he said, referring to Skyway Stage 3 project whose groundbreaking rites were held Wednesday. Building this alternative highway is expected to create traffic problems so everyone should make adjustments.

2014-01-27,,,,"As if the traffic situation in the metropolis were not bad enough, the Metro Manila Development Authority has warned residents to brace for worse conditions in the next few years, when a number of construction projects will be undertaken by the government. Coming on the heels of the public outcry against the shocking power rate increase, the announcement has worried many residents who have to waste many hours sitting in traffic while heading to and coming from work. The MMDA last week advised motorists and commuters to brace for heavy traffic until 2016: Thirteen road and mass transport projects of the Departments of Transportation and Communications and of Public Works and Highways are to start, and there will be a point when they will happen simultaneously. Among the projects are the common station that will connect LRT 1 and MRT 3 in Quezon City in July 2014-September 2015; the LRT 2 extension on Marcos Highway from Santolan station to Sumulong Highway, November 2014-June 2016; the road project connecting Bonifacio Global City to Ortigas Center, starting in July; a 4-lane underpass project on Gil Puyat Avenue that will pass through the intersections of Makati Avenue and Paseo de Roxas starting in April; and the proposed Edsa North-Mindanao Avenue interchange and the Circumferential Road 3 (C3) project. In the long run, Metro Manila residents can look forward to a better transport infrastructureand possibly better traffic flowafter all these projects shall have been finished. However, even before these projects begin, it behooves the MMDA and other government agencies to put in place measures to mitigate the impact on traffic. Among the most urgent is to discipline bus drivers who weave in and out of Edsa and Commonwealth Avenue in shameless disregard of other motorists, then stop nearly perpendicular to the road on bus stops, in the process blocking the flow of traffic. We disagree with the observation that Filipino drivers are simply bad, reckless and rude drivers. The Subic free port, where almost everyone who has been there is all praise for the road discipline, proves this. The MMDA must also ban parking on the streets. A drive around the metropolis will show that many vehicle owners have made roadsides their permanent parking slots, believingwronglythat the street in front of their house is part of their property. Fixing stoplights and ensuring that traffic enforcers are at work at key intersections especially during rush hours in the morning and early evening will also help ease the traffic congestion. Educating drivers about the yellow boxes at intersections is another measure that the MMDA can undertake. The government can also move to phase out old cars and trucks that ply major thoroughfares ever so slowly. As it is, one vehicle that breaks down on Edsa can cause traffic to pile up for kilometers. The government must also remove jeepney and tricycle terminals on the roadsides. Add to these the sidewalk vendors who encroach on as much as two lanes of the road. The MMDA will need the full support of local government units because the mayors and their barangay captains have the influence over those jeepney and tricycle terminals and illegal vendors. The private sector can also do its part by allowing some of its personnel to work at home. It has been estimated that nearly a million people are added to the population of the Makati central business district on regular working days. If only 5-10 percent of these are allowed to work at home, that would mean 50,000 to 100,000 less people driving or commuting to their work places every day. Another possible alleviating measure is to provide incentives to private firms that will revive the Pasig River ferry service. The remaining years of the Aquino administration will truly be bad news for Metro Manila residents insofar as the traffic situation is concerned. We can only hope that the various road and mass transport projects to be undertaken in the next three years will indeed ease traffic flow. The public transport system must improve to a level that will make many car owners leave their vehicles at home and start riding the MRT or public buses to work. When the number of vehicles plying Metro Manilas road network is reduced, traffic will hopefully flow more easily.",,"8:58 PM | Monday, January 27th, 2014",,yes,2014-01-27 00:00:00,reports on traffic congestion,,,,,,,,english,,http://opinion.inquirer.net/70461/making-traffic-flow,,"danao, quezon, metro manila, quezon city, makati, manila, pasig, roxas",text,,317.0,,705.0,,mavie,,,traffic congestion,6.0,Commentary or Editorial,,,,,,inquirer,no,,,,,Making traffic flow | Inquirer Opinion,Pessimistic,,

2014-01-29,,,,"MANILA -- Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) chairman Francis Tolentino said the agency's new P299-million system will help solve traffic problems and even assist police in crime prevention. Tolentino said they upgraded the MMDA's system because of a need to enter the digital stage. The system, he said, uses the Hermes software wherein they can control the traffic lights from the new command center. ""Using loop sensors and detectors, we will be able to command the traffic light, change it from red to green, if there is no volume in a particular lane. So there is no more need for a mano-mano system wherein we send out motorcycles just to fix the traffic lights,"" Tolentino said. The detectors, Tolentino explained, are embedded in the pavement, which measures the volume of vehicles passing by an intersection, as well as the density of vehicles during a particular time of day. ""We are able to count the number of vehicles, and later on, we will have the ability to forecast traffic by using these counters,"" he added, saying the new system is patterned after that of Barcelona, Madrid, Portugal and some other European countries. According to Tolentino, they now have the ability to respond instantly to accidents, which is one of the major causes of traffic congestion in the city. Because they have 175 cameras placed in major thoroughfares and underpasses in the city, Tolentino said they can easily divert traffic if needed, not to mention their ability to respond during rush hours. ""Even during disasters, we can now dispatch flood control teams and provide libreng sakay,"" he added. ""Another 100 cameras will be installed in the first quarter of the year,"" Tolentino said. ""This will make it easier for us to monitor big events, like the just concluded Pista ng Poong Nazareno, as well as rallies and other mass actions,"" he said. Tolentino said their new software also has facial recognition, and would be able to track down the whereabouts of criminals, and post an alarm to the authorities if the subject is within the vicinity. ""Eventually we will tie up with the PNP to have an interconnection with Crame so they can utilize the system,"" he said. The MMDA chairman said they have just finished with the first phase of upgrading the system, and they have until 2016 to complete three more phases to cover the entire city's 455 intersections.",- Reports from ANC,ABS-CBNnews.com,Metropolitan Manila Development Authority,yes,2014-01-29 00:00:00,"reports on traffic congestion,new traffic monitoring technology",,,,,,,,english,,http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/01/28/14/new-mmda-system-help-solve-traffic-mess,,manila,text,,375.0,,874.0,,candice,,,traffic congestion,5.5,Straight News,,,,,improvement of traffic enforcement,abs-cbnnews,no,no,,,,New MMDA system to help solve traffic mess,Neutral,,
2014-01-30,,,"Government agencies, Transport sector leaders","MANILA -- Don Mariano Transit Corporation, owner of a bus that fell off the Skyway last December, has given P150,000 to all victims of the crash, who correspondingly signed quit claims. During the House Committee on Transportation's congressional investigation on the bus crash on Wednesday, Kabataan Party List Rep. Terry Ridon also expressed concern over the plight of the laid-off bus workers due to the wholesale cancellation of the bus line's franchise. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board cancelled Don Mariano's franchise following the crash, which the LTFRB earlier justified before the panel. ""LTFRB said this is the first time that they did a wholesale cancellation of the franchise. Skyway said their cameras showed that the bus ran way above the speed limit,"" Ridon said. Ridon added, ""We also questioned whether LTFRB gravely abused its discretion in the wholesale cancellation of the franchise because it was based on previous suspensions, non-roadworthiness of the vehicles, participation in an MMDA protest, and non-registration of an engine in one of its buses."" Ridon described the hearing as more of ""a fact-finding exercise,"" as the panel gave no actual recommendations of action. For his part, Quezon City Rep. Winston Castelo sought the enforcement of the rule on the mandatory phaseout of 15-year-old public buses and their immediate replacement of new units, to promote road safety and prevent frequent accidents involving public vehicles. Castelo said that in the hearing, LTFRB chair Winston Ginez admitted there is a ""loophole"" in the implementation of the existing rule on 15-year-old public buses: a Bureau of Customs rule states that the date of reckoning starts on the date an imported second hand bus enters the country, and not the date of its manufacture, unlike locally procured public buses.",,"by RG Cruz, ABS-CBN News","LTFRB, House Committee on Transportation Congress",yes,2014-01-30 00:00:00,"road crashes,formulation of legislationlocal ordinances,enforcement of existing lawsordinances,nonfiling of charges against bus operator",,,,,,,,english,,http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/01/29/14/why-bus-crash-victims-wont-sue-don-mariano,,"quezon city, quezon",text,#donmarianoskyway,71.0,,1061.0,,mavie,"This article leads in with the report that Don Mariano Transit Corporation has given 150,000 php each to all victims of the Skyway crash in exchange for waiving their right to file charges or make claims against the bus company.

2014-02-06,,killed:2,,"CEBU CITY Two graduating high school students were killed while four others were badly injured on Thursday afternoon in a vehicular accident at a town in Cebu. The accident at Barangay (village) Poblacion, Boljoon town, about 103 kilometers south of here, claimed the lives of Judy Ann Lomera, 17, a resident of the village, who died on the spot from severe head injuries, andChristy Marie Estella, 18, who died at the hospital in Cebu City in the evening. Both were fourth year students at the Boljoon National High School and were supposed to graduate this March. Wounded were Joanne Marie Romero, 16 and 4th year students at the Boljoon National High School; and Melissa Mendez, 14, her cousin Kynth Marie Mendez, 14 and Nice Ancheta, 15, all sophomore students of the same school. The driver, Al-Dhinier Sanaani, 26 and a medical representative, was detained at the police detention cell pending the filing of reckless imprudence resulting to homicide and multiple physical charges. Sanaani and Kristine Joyce Batucan, 26, both medical representatives of Menarini Philippines Inc., were heading home to Cebu City after delivering medicines in Dumaguete City in Negros Oriental. The car was owned by Batucan but Sanaani drove the vehicle because she was not feeling well. Senior Police Officer 3 Roderick Roma, investigator at the Boljoon Police station, said the car was running at a speed of between 70 and 80 kilometers per hour when Sanaani suddenly realized that the vehicle was at the edge of the road and was only about two meters away from the right railings of Lusapon Bridge along the national highway. Roma said Sanaani immediately swerved the vehicle to the left but the car hit the students who were walking home from school about 4 p.m. The girls were thrown off the bridge and fell about 13 meters below. The car rammed into the railings and turned turtle. Sanaani and Batucan suffered minor injuries. Lomera, Romero and Estella landed on the boulder at the side of the river. The three other girls fell on the riverbank. Lomera died on the spot. Most of the victims were unconscious when they were brought to the municipal health center before they were transferred to hospital in Cebu City.

2014-02-05,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesAfter regulating the entry of buses to ease traffic, the city of Manila is imposing an expanded truck ban starting next week, a measure affecting the cargo moving business while promising relief to other motorists and commuters. Before the ban could even take effect, the head of a truckers organization warned of dire economic consequences, saying its proponents at City Hall were committing political suicide by undermining port operations in the city itself. Starting Monday, Feb. 10, eight-wheel trucks and vehicles with gross weight above 4,500 kilograms are barred from using Manila roads from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. Thats a total of 16 hours, or seven hours longer than the previous ban. They can operate only from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m.and only on designated truck routes. On Sundays and holidays, they can take these routes anytime of the day. Trucks carrying perishable goods and petroleum products are exempted from the ban, as well as vehicles used for government projects. Vehicles that need to deliver construction materials outside the truck routes should seek permission from the Manila Traffic and Parking Bureau. Violators must pay a P5,000 fine or their vehicles will be impounded. An ordinance calling for the daytime ban was signed Wednesday by former President and now Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada, who said he would be ready to face any resistance. I might wear my fatigue uniform again, Estrada said, referring to the military outfit he wore in August last year when he confronted defiant drivers who tried to enter the city despite the bus ban. A separate, metrowide truck ban is imposed by the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA), from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. and from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m, every day except Sundays and holidays. Councilor Manuel Zarcal, the main proponent of the new ban in Manila, said the previous ban was from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. to 9 p.m. With the implementation of a longer ban, additional truck routes were designated, he said. Vice Mayor Francisco Isko Moreno Domagoso warned truckers against staging a protest by blocking roads with their vehicles. We are coordinating with all towing companies in Metro Manila to accommodate 4,000 (impounded) trucks, he said. Thats about the number of trucks passing through the city daily, he said. In July 2013, the truckers group Aduana Business Club Inc. (ABCI) protested a law on overloading by forming a caravan on Roxas Boulevard. Though the action was directed at the Department of Public Works and Highways, the resulting traffic jam drew the ire of Estrada, who warned the group not to do it again. Domagoso maintained that proper consultations on the ordinance were held with various stakeholders through public hearings and a traffic summit. Reached for comment, ABCI president Mary Zapata called the new ban a form of political suicide on the part of its proponents and a bane to a country heavily dependent on imports. If the trucks stop, the economy will stop, Zapata told the Inquirer. If delivery (hours) for cargo are shortened, there will be congestion at the port. Who operates at nighttime to accommodate deliveries? The factories that will receive the cargo, the shipping linesthey will not accommodate our transactions, she said. Zapata said various trucking companies voiced their opposition to the new ban during the first hearing conducted by the council. They would meet among themselves this Monday to plan their next step, she said. If (the city government is) decided on implementing this, we will ask the trade and transportation departments and Malacaang to step in, she added.

2014-02-08,,,Transport sector leaders,"MANILA, Philippines  The bus that fell off a ravine in Bontoc, Mountain Province and killed 14 passengers may have had loose brakes, according to the preliminary investigation of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). In a phone interview with INQUIRER.net Saturday, LTFRB chair Winston Ginez quoted the conductor as saying the bus had loose brakes. The conductor was reported to have jumped out of the bus before it lost its brakes and fell off a 100-meter ravine early Friday morning. According to our preliminary investigation, the bus lost control due to loose brakes, Ginez said in Filipino. The LTFRB has ordered a preventive suspension for 30 days on the 228 buses of G.V. Florida Transport after it was found out that the ill-fated bus was issued with a license plate that belonged to another bus to make it appear it could be used as a hired vehicle. The board also found out that the bus was authorized under the name of Norberto Cue, who had not filed an approval for the sale and transfer to Florida Transport. This means that the Florida Transport was not authorized to operate the bus, LTFRB said. Among those killed were comedian Arvin Tado Jimenez, musician David Sicam, visual artist Gerard Baja, and 11 others. Meanwhile, 32 were injured including the driver and the conductor. The crash came more than a month after a Don Mariano Transit bus fell off the Skyway near Bicutan crashed onto a van below. The accident killed 19, including the bus driver.

2014-02-09,,killed:1,,"Five people died after a passenger jeepney carrying 33 people fell into a roadside canal in Baay-Licuan town in Abra province on Saturday evening, a local police official said Sunday, just two days after 14 people were killed in a bus accident also in northern Luzon. Supt. Davy Vicente Limmong of the Cordillera Regional Police Office said the accident occurred at about 6 p.m. in Sitio Balitungan, Barangay Nalbuan. One of the fatalities was declared dead upon arrival at the hospital while the four others died while being treated, Limmong said. Citing an initial police report, he said the jeepney (AYG 368) driven by Victor Gallotan Pacio, was coming from Barangay Nalbuan's Sitio Baquero and heading downhill towards Brgy. Mapisla. While negotiating a sharp curve, its brakes malfunctioned. Out of control, the vehicle fell into a canal and flipped on its side, Limmong said. One Melba Millare was declared dead upon arrival at a hospital. Slomen Colangan, Veronica Tucio, Noreen Tugadi, and Dimple Tugadi were declared dead while undergoing treatment, he added. Moreover, he said nine of those wounded were taken to the Abra Christian Hospital and eight others were rushed to the Seares Memorial Hospital.

2014-02-10,liable party: bus driver; name: Edgar Renon; liability: multiple homicide and physical injuries; status: facing charges / ,,Transport sector leaders," A faulty emergency brake and the absence of an exhaust brake. These were among the defects investigators found on the ill-fated passenger bus that plunged into a ravine last Friday in Bontoc, Mt. Province, killing 14 people and injuring 32 others. A report on GMA News TV's ""Balita Pilipinas"" on Monday said investigators ruled that the accident was caused by mechanical failure after they went to the crash site and inspected the bus. The investigating team was composed of local police and mechanics from the auto equipment inspection of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), the report said. The report said the mechanics first checked the engine and the lower part of the bus, which remained intact except for the disaligned wheels. Further inspection, however, showed that there was a problem with the emergency brake. The mechanics also discovered that the busowned and operated by GV Floridahad no exhaust brake. An exhaust brake closes off the exhaust manifold from the engine through a valve, creating huge amounts of backpressure in the cylinders, which then slows the pistons down and eventually slows the engine down. An emergency brake, meanwhile, helps prevent rollback when starting on a hill or steep area. It is not powered by hydraulics and independent of the service brakes used to slow and stop vehicles. The report said investigators saw skid marks at the portion of the Banaue-Bontoc national highway where the bus came, proof that its brake failed. The bus was plying the highway from Banaue going to Kalinga when the mechanical problem occurred. The tires also exploded when it caught a protruding steel from the gutter of the highway. The report said bus driver Edgar Renon admitted that he had a problem with the brakes, although he denied that he was sleepy when the accident happened. Charges of multiple homicide and physical injuries will be filed against Renon, who is still recuperating in the hospital, the report said. Lawyer Alex Versoza, lead counsel for the bus company, earlier said the accident was not caused by faulty brakes, but by human error. He said the bus had a braking system designed to automatically stop the vehicle in case the brakes fail. [Dahil sa] technology na Maxi Brake, hindi mawawalan ng preno ['yung bus], kasi 'yung technology na yan, 'pag nagka-depekto, ila-lock nung mekanismo 'yung brake at titigil 'yung bus, Verzosa said. The lawyer said the existence of the braking system disproves the theory that the bus fell down a ravine in Bontoc, Mountain Province because it lost its brakes. Hindi tugma, technically, yung sinasabi ng iba na nawalan ng preno [yung bus], he said. Verzosa said the accident was most likely caused by the bus driver miscalculating the sharpness of the roads curve because of heavy fog. Its a one-lane road at super kapal daw 'yung fog early in the morning. Nagkaroon ng miscalculation doon sa kurbada, he said. The Land Transportation and Franchising Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has imposed a 30-day preventive suspension on all 228 buses in the Florida Transport fleet. The units also underwent roadworthiness testing. In an interview with News To Go Monday, LTFRB executive director Roberto Cabrera admitted they were not able to inspect the buses of GV Florida. Before nangyari ito, umiikot na yung LTFRB sa iba pang terminal. Napakarami lang po, inabot lang po kami. Hindi pa namin na-inspection. Unfortunately the accident happened before we could inspect, he said. He said there will be no shortage of buses plying the Bontoc route as the agency is ready to grant special permits to other bus companies. The LTFRB is willing and able to grant special permits to other companies kung talagang may shortage ng bus na nagta-traverse sa routes na ito, para mapunuan ang pangangailangan ng publiko, he said. Meanwhile, the DPWH offices in Mt. Province and Cordillera Administrative Region denied the claim of Versoza that the accident happened when the driver avoided a road repair on the highway. Fred Siasitao, engineer II at DPWH Mt Province, told GMA News Online over the phone that no road construction project was ongoing in the area. In a separate phone interview, Juliet Aban, public information officer at DPWH CAR, confirmed Siasitao's statement, adding if there was road construction in the area, there would have been warning signs telling the drivers to slow down. Nung last na na-inspection ko yung lugar [ay] konkreto 'yun, walang lubak, maganda 'yung kalsada, she said. She added that the part of the highway where the incident happened was not an accident prone area.

LTFRB chairman Winston Ginez led the confiscation of license plates at the company's bus terminal in Sampaloc, Manila. GV Florida Transport owns a total of 208 bus units, but only 27 were at the Sampaloc terminal as the other buses were in different provincial terminals. The LTFRB is also checking if all the other bus units are registered. The 27 bus units will be brought to the Land Transportation Office (LTO) for a road worthiness test, while the drivers will undergo a drug test and seminar. Ginez added that they will try to give their decision on the case before the 30-day preventive suspension on the company ends. The agency is investigating reports that the bus involved in the accident is not registered under the company, as it is owned by Mt. Province Cable Tours. Atty. Alexander Versoza, GV Florida Transport's legal counsel, admitted that the bus is indeed owned by Norberto Que Sr. of Mt. Province Cable Tours. He added, however, that GV Florida has already bought it and that the transfer of ownership is still being processed by the LTFRB. Versoza added that they know that what they did is illegal, but they still have to provide service to passengers, otherwise, they will be charged with abandonment. GV Florida Transport bought 10 bus units from Mt. Province Cable Tours. The company is also in the process of buying more bus units from Dangwa Tranco and Dagupan Bus. The company assured the public that they will face all charges that will be filed against them.","-- report from Dennis Datu, dzMM",ABS-CBNnews.com,,yes,2014-02-09 00:00:00,enforcement of existing lawsordinances,,,,,,,,english,,http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/02/09/14/ltfrb-confiscates-florida-bus-license-plates,,"dagupan, manila",text,#bontocbustragedy,465.0,,614.0,,candice,,,traffic enforcement and violations,5.5,Straight News,,,,,,abs-cbnnews,yes,no,,,,LTFRB confiscates Florida bus license plates,Neutral,,
2014-02-09,,fatalities:1,,"BONTOC, Mt. Province, PhilippinesThere was an eerie calm at the Bontoc General Hospital early Saturday as hospital workers were preparing the remains of comedian Arvin Jimenez, more popularly known as Tado. A hearse was parked outside the hospital, waiting to drive Jimenezs body back to his relatives in Metro Manila. The comedians brother-in-law, Victor Ramoso, and friends represented by Kate Lim, arrived here to claim the remains of the comedian, who was one of the 14 people killed when the passenger bus they were riding in fell into a ravine in Barangay Talubin here on Friday. All the fatalities were laid out in cots at the hospital chapel, covered with white blankets. Later Saturday, they were placed in separate coffins, except for the remains of Marcial Baranda Jr., Jimenezs friend, which were placed in a body bag to accompany Jimenezs casket in the hearse. The hearse left Bontoc shortly after 2 p.m. for the 345-kilometer journey to the national capital. Senior Supt. Oliver Enmodias, Mt. Province police director, said the police had no idea what condition Jimenezs body was in when it was recovered from the wreckage. Enmodias had described him as a man with long hair. Aside from Baranda, Jimenez had several other friends traveling with him on the G.V. Florida Transport bus that crashed into a rice field at the bottom of a ravine in Talubin at 7:20 a.m. on Friday. Jimenez and eight other passengers died instantly. The bodies of some of the fatalities were mangled or torn, police and rescue workers said. The dead included a Dutch woman, Anne Martina Adriana Van de Ven, and Canadian Alex Loring. A television crew from the Solar News Network also showed up in Bontoc to fetch the remains of their creative director, Giovanni Bam Morillo, who was with the Jimenez group. Police here said eight of the 32 survivors were treated at the Luis Hora Memorial Regional Hospital in Bauko town, while 24 were taken to the Bontoc General Hospital, including 32-year-old Annenmik Verwegen, a Dutch national. On Saturday, a group of foreigners visited Verwegen at the hospital as she waited to be airlifted to Baguio City. The foreigners declined to talk to the Inquirer. Police said eight of the survivors who were taken to the two Mt. Province hospitals were airlifted by military helicopter to hospitals in Baguio City on Friday. The 7-year-old boy who survived the crash, Agong Sicam, was flown to a Manila hospital with another survivor, Abegail Sicam, a musician. Another fatality, Andrew David Sicam, was also a musician. Some of the survivors said they were asleep when the bus met the accident, 12 hours after it had left from Sampaloc, Manila. Carina Codiamat, 27, Barangay Can-eo here, said: I was awakened when the bus crashed. I remember feeling the rush of air as the bus plunged down, then I was rolling around. Codiamat was thrown from the bus, rescuers said. When I regained consciousness, I heard children crying, she said. Bernhardt Beshtold, a Quezon City resident who also lives in Austria, described the accident as surreal. It was very fast, very intense. [It happened] in a flash that we couldnt react on time It seemed very unreal, said Beshtold, who suffered cuts and bruises on his face. Olivia Aglipay, 29, of Barangay Bangnen in Bontoc, was awake when the bus crashed. Aglipay could not speak because of injuries to her face. But she indicated through gestures to her cousin, Viola Loma-ang, that the bus driver lost control of the bus, possibly because the brakes failed. Loma-ang, interpreting Aglipays gestures, said one of the passengers noticed that the bus had lost its brakes and had panicked just before the vehicle fell into the ravine. Enmodias said investigators concluded the accident was due to mechanical failure and human error. He said criminal charges were being prepared against the owners of Florida. Celina Claver, the Cordillera regional director of the Department of Transportation and Communications, said the Florida fleet serving the Manila-Bontoc and Sagada-Manila route used to be operated by a Bontoc-based tour bus company.

2014-02-10,,,Transport sector leaders,"MANILA  A government official on Monday said the drivers of G.V. Florida Transport Inc. should blame the bus company and not the government for their disenfranchisement as a result of an accident in Mt. Province last Friday. Speaking to dzMM, Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board chairman Winston Ginez said the LTFRB, given its limited manpower, has been doing all it can to ensure the safety of commuters. ""Sa pagkakataong ito huwag niyong sisihin ang gobyerno. Sisihin ninyo ang management. Bakit nila ginawa ang ganito, dahil ba sa kumikita sila? Sisihin niyo ang maintenance, ang mga mekaniko. Sisihin niyo na ang lahat huwag lang ang gobyerbo, dahil ang gobyerno ginagawa ang trabaho,"" Ginez said. The LTFRB earlier suspended about 238 units of Florida Transport for 30 days after one of its units fell off a ravine in Bontoc, Mt. Province and killed 15 people, including comedian Arvin ""Tado"" Jimenez. The LTFRB said 10 of the Florida units, including the one that figured in the Bontoc accident, were registered under Mt. Province Cable Tours owned by Norberto Que Sr. It pointed out that no application for approval of sale and transfer has been filed by Que in favor of Florida Transport. The ill-fated unit had a Florida body marking but its plate number was assigned to Mt. Province Cable Tours. Moreover, the chassis and engine of the Florida bus were tampered and not registered with the Land Transportation Office (LTO). Therefore, the bus was not authorized to operate as a for-hire vehicle, the LTFRB said. ""Ginamit nila ang lumang plaka ni Mr. Que na TXT 872 na dating nakakabit sa phased out unit. Kinuha at ikinabit sa isang unit na hindi pa dumaan sa inspection ng LTFRB at LTO at pinangalandakan nilang ito ay PUV,"" Ginez said. ""In layman's term, sa land transportation language, kambal-plaka iyan. Kaya napakatindi ng violation na ito. This is a blatant multiple violator."" Atty. Alexander Versoza, GV Florida Transport's legal counsel, earlier admitted that the bus is indeed owned by Norberto Que Sr. of Mt. Province Cable Tours. He added, however, that GV Florida has already bought it and that the transfer of ownership is still being processed by the LTFRB. The company is also in the process of acquiring more bus units from Dangwa Tranco and Dagupan Bus. G.V. Florida Transport Inc. co-founder Virgilio Florida Jr. said the decision to acquire the franchises from other bus companies was due to the rising demand for trips to Sagada. Both companies were given 72 hours from the receipt of the order to submit a show cause explaining why their Certificate for Public Conveyance (CPC) should not be suspended or cancelled or revoked. A hearing on the case has been set on February 19. The inspection of the remaining Florida units continued today. The camp of Jimenez said that while it supports the LTFRB action to suspend the bus company's fleet, it is not indifferent to the plight of the other bus drivers who temporary lost their jobs due to the accident. Leni Velasco, spokesperson of DAKILA artists' group which Jimenez co-founded in 2005, said Jimenez's friends and family are still deliberating their official position on the matter. ""Isa po ito sa mga diskusyon sa grupo at sa pamilya, wala pa kaming opisyal na posisyon dahil pinag-aaralan namin ang mga best na hakbang. Si Tado kasi napaka pro-manggagawa noon kaya alam namin ang magiging epekto nito sa manggagawa ng bus comapny na walang kinalaman sa pangyayaring ito,"" Velasco told ABS-CBN's ""Umagang Kay Ganda."" Velasco also called the accident an irony since Jimenez had advocated road safety. ""Napaka-ironic na sa sarili niya pang kampanya niya siya ang nabiktima. Nakakalungkot na paarng ang magiging behikulo pa para mas maging aware ang publiko ay itong pagkamatay ni Tado,"" Velasco said.",,"By Dharel Placido, ABS-CBNnews.com","LTFRB, GV Florida Transport, Inc",yes,2014-02-10 00:00:00,followup report on franchise suspension,,,,,,,,english,yes,http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/02/10/14/ltfrb-florida-drivers-dont-blame-govt,,dagupan,text,#bontocbustragedy,17.0,,185.0,,mavie,,,road crash incident,8.5,Straight News,,,,,stricter public transport franchise regulation,abs-cbnnews,yes,no,,,,LTFRB to Florida drivers: Don't blame gov't,Neutral,,

During a press conference, presidential spokesperson Edwin Lacierda said Aquino will be calling for a meeting of relevant agencies concerned with road safety.  ""Road safety is a concern... the President is concerned,"" he said.  But asked when the meeting will be, he said it has yet to be set.  Lacierda said the President mentioned the meeting after , killing at least 14. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board has imposed a 30-day preventive suspension on the firm.  ""Hes very concerned with respect to the situation with respect to the buses, how things are happening despite the rules that we have in place, so hes calling for a meeting of the relevant government agencies,"" he said.

""I think this is the first time where you saw the entire franchise of a bus transportation cancelled,"" he said.  Asked what else the government can do aside from cancelling the bus franchise, he said aggrieved parties can take ""legal and judicial actions.""  ""Insofar as the government is concerned, you hit them where it hurts most to them insofar as profitability is concerned.

He likewise said that can ensure that the firms comply with government standards before they can operate.  ""Remember that franchise is a privilege and it is not a right under our public transportation laws.

2014-02-11,,,"Transport sector leaders, Bus company owner"," MANILA -- The Land Transportation Office (LTO) is set to file a complaint within the week against G.V. Florida Transport Inc. for committing multiple violations of the Land Transportation and Traffic Code. Based on initial findings, the Florida bus that figured in the Bontoc, Mountain Province road accident last Friday was not registered with the LTO. The ill-fated bus also used an old plate number of a phased-out vehicle. Speaking to ANC on Tuesday, Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) Chairman Winston Ginez said the bus firm is in danger of having its license revoked after transport officials uncovered a slew of violations committed by the company. These include operating a bus using the franchise of Mt. Province Cable Tours without the authorization for sale and transfer from the LTFRB. ""Inamin nga din po ng abogado ng G.V. Florida that even knowing that without the approval of the LTFRB, he reasoned out that it was because they had to fulfill the demands of the public, they plied the road without approval of LTFRB. So my question when he will appear before our hearing on February 19: Does the end justify the means?"" Ginez said. The LTFRB has suspended the entire fleet of Florida Transport for 30 days and required its units to undergo road worthiness inspections at the LTO. Meanwhile, Ginez insisted that the bus company must face up to its obligations to the victims of last week's deadly bus crash. He noted that just last week, bus companies had been required to put P30 million in escrow with accredited banks for passenger accident liability insurance. He said the LTFRB is now coordinating with insurance agencies and the Insurance Commission about the compensation for the victims' families even though the bus was colorum. ""The victims should not suffer from the misjudgment or the illegal activities of the buses,"" Ginez said. The LTFRB, meanwhile, is also eyeing a yearly accreditation of bus drivers and a meeting with public utility vehicle (PUV) owners about a database of drivers. --",Report from ANC,ABS-CBNnews.com,"LTFRB, LTO",yes,2014-02-11 00:00:00,"road crashes,enforcement of existing lawsordinances,filing of complaint against bus company",,,,,,,,english,no,http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/02/11/14/lto-file-complaint-vs-florida-transport,,mountain province,text,#bontocbustragedy,46.0,,77.0,,mavie,,,"policy and legislation, public transportation regulation, traffic enforcement and violations",7.5,Straight News,,,,,"stricter public transport franchise regulation, bus driver accreditation, assembly of database of bus drivers",abs-cbnnews,yes,no,,,,LTO to file complaint vs Florida Transport,Neutral,,
2014-02-11,,,"Government agencies, Transport sector leaders","MANILA  Social media users on Tuesday gave varying reactions on the spate of bus accidents in the country. TV Patrol posted on its social media accounts the question of whether or not the people believe that the regulations being implemented by the government for passenger buses are enough. Most users replied negatively, saying that the regulations are not enough and even lead to more accidents in the streets. Thayk Ferols said regulatory bodies should impose stricter measures depending on the franchise or route the vehicles are registered under. ""Not enough. I think regulatory bodies should impose stricter safety measures appropriate in a given franchise. For instance, vehicles plying mountainous areas should have water cooling system installed in brakes to avoid meltdown. Thirty minutes of sustained braking will literally turn your brake drums and pads glow red hot,"" Ferols said. Others suggested possible regulations that the government and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) may consider adding. Luzviminda Bebita said all vehicles should undergo annual road safety and environmental standards checks. She also warned that these checks must be bribe-free. ""Dapat di nadadaan sa bayad.

2014-02-11,,,"Public officials, Government agencies","Once again we are confronted with horrific commercial bus accidents claiming the lives of passengers. And once again we see and read that the Land Transportation Office and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board are quick to look for faults and cast blame on the erring bus companies. But have they ever done anything to minimize, if not prevent, the occurrence of such catastrophes? What really is the role of the LTO? What is its mandate? Is not one if its duties to try to make sure that vehicles are safe for both drivers and passersby? And how can it accomplish this duty? Is it not to see that the vehicles which are brought to its offices nationwide yearly are safe to traverse the roads? What, outside of its yearly collection of registration fees, does it do? Is there a vehicle owner who can say or point out that the LTO has inspected his/her vehicle for its roadworthiness? And yet every time one goes to the LTO for reregistration, one fills up a form that has items to be checked and these items concern the roadworthiness of the vehicle. What is the only thing LTO inspectors (or, in truth, non-LTO persons who do the dirty work) do outside of the stenciling of chassis and engine numbers? That, ostensibly, is to flush out stolen engines or cars. And is that effective in ensuring vehicle safety? Car manufacturers do not bother about the LTOs stencil requirements and they emboss their engine numbers deep down where it is very hard to get to the numbers to be stenciled. See Toyota engines! Where else in the world can one find an LTO equivalent that only collects fees and nothing else? Just look at the easily seen car plates. Is it not one of the purposes for installing a license plate at the back of a vehicle to give an onlooker the number of a hit-and-run vehicle? Or for a police car chasing a speeding car to immediately notify other police units of the license plate of the car being chased? And yet what does one see in many of these plates? Plates that are hardly readable. And, going back to the bus accidents, the LTO and LTFRB have once again blared the its their fault trumpets. Tampered registration papers, mismatched license plates, poor brakes, etc. Do these government agencies not even have computers to give off warning signals that a bus is long due for inspection? Computers can be programmed, unless LTOs computers are only programmed to record payments and collections. Does it not have a facility to check brakes, especially those of public transport? I had a chance to reregister an old car in Australia and immediately upon entering their agency I was told to follow the cars ahead of me. There was a notice not to vacate the car. At each point an inspector checked my lights, horn, wipers, etc. telling me what to turn on, then an inspection of seat belts, tires (the groove was measured), engine, and brakes (by inspectors under a facility where the car passes over). There were manometers for measuring brake efficiency. The only time I was allowed to get out of the car was at the end of the inspection line when I had to pay and find out if my car passed the inspection or not. The LTO today, I suppose, is saddled with the more important (to them) problem of producing new car plates and registration stickers. I had to wait two full months to get my registration stickers.

2014-02-11,,,Transport sector leaders," Eleven of GV Florida Inc.'s fleet of twenty-five buses failed a series of road worthiness tests conducted by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Tuesday. The company's entire fleet was inspected after one of their buses crashed into a ravine in Bontoc town last Friday, and 15 passengers were killed including comedian Arvin Tado Jimenez. The tests that the buses underwent included emission testing, equipment checks and other minor defect checks according to a report from GMA's 24-Oras program on Tuesday. Land Transportation Office (LTO) inspector Willie Javier said that seemingly minor test such as seatbelt and windshield checks were a must to determine road worthiness. Kapag nangyari yung accident 'yung pasahero baka madisgrasya [pag walang seatbelt], Javier explained. 'Yung broken windshield naman baka during the travel mabasag yan. Kaya hindi road worthy yun. Almost half of the buses inspected also had incomplete body markings, the report said. During Monday's tests, two buses failed the emission test while another two were found to have defective windshields. While the testing was going on, GV Florida's drivers and conductors participated in the LTO's road regulations seminar. Fog and sand Meanwhile, GV Florida Transport Inc. legal counsel, Atty. Alex Versoza explained that the bus crash was due to multiple factors including road conditions. Versoza said that thick fog paired with sandy roads, as well as the lack of road barriers may have ultimately caused the crash. Walang kaming sinisisi dito. Ipinapaliwanag lang namin 'yung sitwasyon doon sa pinangyarihan ng aksidente, he said. But the LTFRB Exec. Director Atty. Roberto Cabrera reiterated that the ill-fated bus was on the road illegally. Ang narinig ko po sa news may hamog, may mga buhangin, may mga construction, whatsoever.

2014-02-11,,,,"(Updated 3:35 p.m.) The driver of the Florida Transport bus that plunged into a ravine last Friday in Bontoc, Mountain Province claimed that he lost control of the vehicle due to brake failure.  ""[Huminto] po tapos, kuwan, biglang nag-abante tapos 'yun na. Nagulat ako kasi na-lost control na ako roon e. [Tapos] sumabog 'yung gulong,"" driver Edgar Renon was quoted as saying in a GMA News report by Hadji Rieta.    Renon is still recuperating in the hospital. He is waiting to be assisted by a lawyer before submitting his affidavit.  As soon as the brakes failed, the driver called the attention of the passengers and the conductor, the report noted.  The ill-fated bus killed 15 people and injured 32 others, PO2 Romel Chaokas of the Mt. Province Police told GMA News Online in a phone interview on Tuesday. Among the fatalities are comedian Tado Jimenez, musician David Sicam and visual artists Gerard Baja. Chaokas said 47 people were aboard the bus on that trip.  Meanwhile, a witness told investigators that the bus was not moving fast when the incident happened, adding that three people flagged down the bus. However, it was not able to stop, which led to the tragic event.  ""Noong dumating dito (about 800 meters from the accident area) dahan-dahan ['yung takbo] tapos pinapara 'yung bus ng tatlong tao.

Investigators noted that . The bus was found to have a faulty emergency brake and had no exhaust brake.  Alex Versoza, legal counsel of Florida Transport, debunked the investigators' claim noting that the brakes may have been damaged as the bus fell into the ravine.  ""Baka kung nasira man 'yun, nasira na 'yun nung pagbagsak na, kasi 'di ba tumama-tama rin 'yung ilalim nun,"" Atty. Alex Versoza said in the same television report.    The following is the timeline of events of the bus crash based on investigators' and witnesses' accounts, as pieced together by GMA News reporter Hadji Rieta:   Charges of multiple homicide and physical injuries will be filed against Renon and Florida Transport, the report said.    Meanwhile, the bus crash probers are also looking into the alleged overloading of the passenger bus.  Based on records, there were 47 people inside the bus when the crash happened. However, only 44 should have been inside the vehicle.  Dutch national , was among those passengers who were not seated as there were no more seats available. Rieta reported van de Ven sat on bags placed in the aisle of the bus.  Like the driver, the bus conductor has yet to submit his affidavit.

2014-02-11,,,"Government agencies, Transport sector leaders","MANILA -- The House independent bloc on Monday called for the resignation of Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) Chairman Winston Ginez, following the Florida bus plunge in Bontoc that killed 14 people, including social advocate Tado Jimenez. Abakada party-list Rep. Jonathan dela Cruz said Ginez is not doing his job, noting that the LTFRB chief does not know how many franchises has been issued. He said Ginez should take responsibility for the bus accidents in Paranaque City as well as Bontoc, Mountain Province. ""There is no franchise system in place right now in the Philippines, there is none, he said. We dont want to have an accident every week, and then his only response is to suspend the bus company that is not a response! We dont have that kind of system that will promote and protect our commuters that is a big, big problem, and if he does not resign immediately he should at least accept responsibilities for these things, he added. The independent bloc also wants an audit of LTFRB officials, citing that the recent accident ""is the second major accident in just several months, the other being the fall from the Skyway of a Don Mariano bus."" ""We want to know, among others, how often land transport officials inspect buses and the premises of their operators; how many, if any, are the public transport companies which have been deemed unsafe for travel and what action has been done against these firms,"" Leyte Rep. Martin Romualdez said in a statement. Meanwhile, House Committee on Transportation Chairman Cesar Sarmiento said they will be including the Florida bus crash in their ongoing investigation of bus accidents in the country. The panel is already investigating the Don Mariano Skyway bus crash from last December, he said. We want to find out the steps of agencies to ensure safety and roadworthiness. Maraming factors na dapat i-consider. Yung road worthiness, every year naman may mandatory requirement of registration. Registration is not allowed if vehicles are not road worthy, Sarmiento said. He added that it would be better if government implements a motor vehicle inspection system, which is a machine- and computer-assisted way of determining the road worthiness of buses. Right now, he said buses are inspected for roadworthiness only through a visual inspection. Sarmiento also said over-speeding can be aggravated by inherent defects in the buses and make accidents bound to happen, based on the Don Mariano bus crash. Sarmiento wants to amend the Motor Vehicle Users Charge law to allow the use of MVUC funds in responding to accidents, noting that most of the victims of road accidents are motorists who paid the MVUC. In the last congressional hearing on the Don Mariano case, some lawmakers raised questions on the fairness of the immediate cancellation of the companys franchise, since the accident was only caused by one driver. Sarmiento wants the LTFRB to be more proactive in cracking down on colorum buses, noting that the bus unit from the Florida bus crash can be considered colorum. He said that based on news accounts, the bus belonged to another company before it came under Florida, which should not have happened without the approval of the LTFRB. That can be avoided by fielding personnel sa terminals before the bus leaves. I-require ang personnel to present documents to determine if colorum ito. In that case, LTFRB has been remiss in trying to detect colorum buses, which have been with us for so long a time. We cannot say what would be the sanctions the committee will recommend, as were still conducting an investigation. We have to include the Florida accident in our future hearings. The investigation is being handled by a technical working group. In the meantime, Sarmiento batted for a bill creating a National Transportation Safety Board, which will be charged to solely investigate all transportation incidents. Patterned after a US agency of the same name, the board will integrate the investigative functions currently being undertaken by different agencies in the transport sector.

2014-02-12,,,Transport sector leaders,"MANILA -- The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) is eyeing mechanical failure and speeding as the possible causes of the accident in Mt. Province last week involving a unit of G.V. Florida Transport Inc. The LTFRB said the vehicle was speeding. The ill-fated bus also supposedly overheated and suffered faulty brakes, causing it to fall off a ravine and leave 15 people dead, including comedian Arvin ""Tado"" Jimenez. Metal skid marks could be seen on the road, a few meters away from the ravine. This is seen as proof that one of bus' tires exploded. ""The bus was speeding on a [downward] slope at tinry pa nung driver na itama ito sa kabilang side pero too late,"" LTFRB chairman Winston Ginez said. ""Kahit saan mo tingnan ito ay malaking kasalanan din It is the responsibility of the operator to ensure na road worthy ang sasakyan at drivers are fit to drive."" Because the bus was not registered with the Land Transportation Office, there is no record of its condition before the accident. G.V. Florida Transport Inc., however, insists that poor road condition is to blame. ""Pabulusok ang kalsada, kurbado, sarado, tapos may nakakalat na buhangin sa concrete portion. Kung kumagat man ang preno hindi na kakagat yung gulong dahil that time mabilis na siya at biglang may kurbada. hindi na nakayanan sa bigat ng bus,"" said G.V. Florida Transport lawyer Alexander Versoza. The Philippine Accident Managers Incorporated (PAMI), meanwhile, said the ill-fated bus is not covered by insurance because its license plate number, TXT 872, belongs to another vehicle. ""Iyung na-aksidente hindi tunay na bus registered with the plate number Hindi naman iyon yung in-insure namin na bus e, so hindi namin babayaran,"" said PAMI chairman Ed Atayde. Under the Insurance Law, each fatality should get P150,000 while the injured should get P20,000 each. Nonetheless, the bus company assured the victims and their families that it will give them financial assistance. While operations of G.V. Florida Transport Inc. are suspended, its fleet will continue to undergo inspections by the LTO.

2014-02-12,,,Transport sector leaders,"Since the past decade, the pink buses of GV Florida Transport Inc., with their distinct floral body marks, have been busy carrying passengers to and from Metro Manila and three regions in northern Luzon: Cagayan Valley, the Ilocos and the Cordillera. This was until the bus crash in Bontoc town in Mt. Province on Feb. 7 that killed at least 14 passengers, mostly tourists, easily making it the companys worst accident in its 15 years of operation. On Saturday, all of the estimated 250 buses of Florida, which has its main provincial terminal in Tuguegarao City in Cagayan province, have been ordered off the road, as part of the 30-day suspension slapped by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) following the Bontoc crash. GV Florida bus company may not have caught much media attention in the past, but even observers noted its dramatic rise to success, making it one of Cagayan Valleys main players in the public utility industry. With its terminals in Sampaloc in Manila and Cubao in Quezon City, Florida plies routes to 43 key cities and towns of Cagayan, Ilocos Norte, Isabela, Nueva Vizcaya, Quirino, Ifugao, Benguet and Mt. Province. The company operates passenger buses with six classifications, most notable of which are its spacious 29-seat super deluxe buses and the sleeper class, equipped with 35 bunk beds. Installed with restrooms, both classes travel nonstop for the 12-hour Manila-Tuguegarao or Manila-Laoag trips. But Florida has its own success story to tell. Records showed that GV Florida started in the late 1970s as Florida Liner, owned by Virgilio Florida Sr., based in Allacapan town in Cagayan. He operated a few mini buses that used to ply short Cagayan routes, such as Tuguegarao-Aparri or Tuguegarao-Claveria, said Manuel Baricaua, regional administrative chief of Land Transportation Office (LTO), Cagayan Valley. In 1999, the bus firm was founded by brothers George and Virgilio as a spinoff of the now-defunct EMC Transportation Inc. that used to ply the Manila-Cagayan routes. It soon expanded its operations to the Ilocos region after acquiring F. Franco Transit and B. Trans, and took over the Ilocos franchise of Autobus Transportation. Soon, Florida became a dominant player as a passenger carrier in the region after it acquired the franchises of the now-defunct Viva Alladin, Ballesteros Express and Dagupan Bus Lines. Baricaua said Florida grew by leaps and bounds because of the supposed good management by its owners. Despite its successes, Florida has had its own share of accidents along the road that had caused deaths and injuries to people. This (Bontoc incident) will be a great challenge for the owners, especially in dealing with the families of the victims, Baricaua said. He also noted that Florida might also have to answer allegations that it has been operating buses illegally, which include those under Dagupan Bus Lines and Cable Tours, the listed operator of the ill-fated bus in the Bontoc tragedy. Baricaua led an on-the-spot inspection of about 40 buses that were parked at its terminal in Tuguegarao City last week. LTO personnel found violations on 17 buses, including switched licensed plates and unrecorded engine numbers, and those operating outside routes specified in the firms franchise. One bus driver was working with an expired license.",Melvin Gascon,"12:22 AM | Wednesday, February 12th, 2014","LTO, LTFRB, GV Florida Transport, Inc",yes,2014-02-12 00:00:00,"road crashes,background on bus company",,,,,,,,english,yes,http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/577028/floridas-hits-misses-along-road-to-success,,"cagayan, laoag, quezon, dagupan, metro manila, manila, benguet, tuguegarao",text,#bontocbustragedy,178.0,,1897.0,,mavie,,,"public transportation regulation, traffic enforcement and violations",6.5,Straight News,,,,,,inquirer,yes,no,,,,"Floridas hits, misses along road to success | Inquirer News",Neutral,,
2014-02-12,,,,"Once again, Quezon City Mayor Herbert Bistek Bautista is not too sold on the traffic scheme being devised by his neighbors in Manila. Bautista on Tuesday took a swipe at the expanded truck ban set to be implemented in Manila, saying officials of local government units should not be parochial in thinking and instead consider the impact of their plans on the rest of the metropolis. Bautista made his sentiments known after attending a meeting called by the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) on Tuesday to discuss the Manila truck ban. Officials from three more cities joined the meeting, but the one invited from ManilaVice Mayor Francisco Isko Moreno Domagosowas a no-show. Maybe for them (its a good idea). But for Metro Manila, I dont think so, Bautista told reporters. The Quezon City mayor chairs the traffic committee of the Metro Manila Council, the policymaking body of the MMDA. MMDA Chair Francis Tolentino presided over the meeting, which also gathered officials from trucking associations and other groups in the cargo moving industry, to thresh out issues arising from Manilas truck ban which will be implemented on Feb. 24. Announced last week by Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada, the new measure bars eight-wheel trucks and vehicles with gross weight of 4,500 kilograms and above from the road from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m., except Sundays and holidays. The MMDA has a separate, metrowide truck ban from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. and from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. Im espousing the sentiments of the truckers, Bautista said. Its similar to the bus ban (which was implemented by Manila last year). We were surprised. We shouldnt be parochial in making policies. We have to look at the effects on the whole of Metro Manila and the economy. Shortly after Manila started regulating the entry of buses in July 2013, Bautista was the first mayor to publicly complain about the resulting traffic jams and other inconveniences for thousands of commuters in his part of the capital, particularly on Quezon Avenue. They can do anything they want but please make sure that every system here in Metro Manila will function as its supposed to function, Bautista added. Reached for comment, Domagoso said: They are entitled to their comments. As far as we are concerned, we have a law here in Manila. Were busy planning its implementation on Feb. 24 as per the directive of President-Mayor Erap Estrada. The City of Manila is being run by President-Mayor Erap Estrada. Were solving our own problems. We dont meddle or intervene with the policies of other cities, Domagoso said in a phone interview. Also present in Tuesdays meeting were Marikina City Mayor Del de Guzman, Las Pias City Vice Mayor Luis Bustamante and Valenzuela City Councilor Lorena Natividad-Borja. De Guzman said we will try to come up with a compromise acceptable to all sectors in the Traffic Management Summit to be held by the MMDA on Feb. 13 and 14. The summit will discuss not only the truck ban but also the upcoming infrastructure projects and the recently approved changes in the academic calendar of top universities. Whatever is agreed upon in that summit becomes policy of the entire Metropolitan Council, and Manila is part of the council, Bautista stressed. Earlier, the Aduana Business Club Inc., Asian Terminals Inc., and the Philippine Ports Authority-Manila International Container Terminal warned that the truck ban could lead to congestion at the ports, delay the delivery of raw materials and ultimately hurt businesses and the national economy.",Erika Sauler,"1:54 AM | Wednesday, February 12th, 2014",QC Mayor,yes,2014-02-12 00:00:00,"enforcement of existing lawsordinances,traffic congestion solutions,truck ban",,,,,,,,english,,http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/577098/qc-mayor-herbert-bautista-manila-truck-ban-not-good-for-rest-of-metro,,"marikina, valenzuela, quezon, metro manila, quezon city, manila",text,,146.0,,1583.0,,mavie,,,"traffic enforcement and violations, traffic congestion",6.5,Straight News,,,,,,inquirer,no,,,,,QC Mayor Herbert Bautista: Manila truck ban not good for rest of Metro | Inquirer News,Neutral,,

Herminio Coloma, Presidential Communications Operations Office secretary, said on a media briefing Wednesday afternoon the Palace would welcome any measures that Congress would pass after a Florida bus slid down a ravine killing 14 people. If there is a chance that the lawmakers in Congress would pass additional measures on road-worthiness and safety would be most welcome, Coloma said. He added President Benigno Aquino III already tasked the Department of Transportation and Communication and its corresponding agencies, the Land Transportation Office and the Land Transportation and Franchising Regulatory Board to enforce already existing laws. Apart from the road-worthiness of public vehicles, Coloma said another issue to be looked at is the concern on the salaries of bus drivers and conductors. One more issue is about the implementation of a fixed salary plus performance-based incentives, Coloma said. We can concur that one of the reasons of road accidents is when drivers speed up their vehicles to make their daily quota, he added.

2014-02-12,,,"Public officials, Government agencies","MANILA, PhilippinesThe rash of vehicular accidents has prompted the government to take a hard look at how the P12-billion road users tax, which is supposed to fund road safety, is being utilized. The total amount collected from car owners each year under the tax, known as the motor vehicle users charge (MVUC), comes to around P10 billion, according to Malacaang. President Aquino is taking a hands-on approach amid the increasing frequency of accidents involving public buses. The President is meeting shortly with the Department of Transportation and Communications, Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) and Land Transportation Office (LTO) to discuss an action plan for preventing accidents and enhancing safety in public transportation, said Communications Secretary Herminio Coloma on Tuesday.

2014-02-12,,,"Government agencies, Transport sector leaders","MANILA, PhilippinesBe proactive instead of being reactionary. This was the advice Jesus Arranza, head of the Federation of Philippine Industries (FPI), gave the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board and the Land Transportation Office on Wednesday as he assailed both agencies for their alleged failure to do their respective mandates. He described as alarming the observation that these two agencies merely react when death occurs in vehicular mishaps. Had the LTFRB and LTO done their jobs, that is, monitoring round-the-clock the franchises and operations of bus companies, then serious road accidents involving buses and other public utility vehicles could have been prevented, Arranza said in a press statement. He said these two agencies share the blame for non-roadworthy vehicles plying routes nationwide. It is only now that they are discovering that the GV Florida Transport bus involved in the Feb. 7 crash in Bontoc, Mountain Province, that killed at least 14 passengers was not even registered under the name of the said company, he said. Moreover, the bus license plates did not match with the engine and chassis. Worse, it was also discovered that the bus had double license plates. He added, Its time for top officials and other personnel of these two agencies to wake up. Last Saturday, the LTFRB ordered all of the estimated 250 buses of Florida off the road as it suspended the bus companys operations for the next 30 days. Operating out of its main terminals in Sampaloc, Manila, and Cubao, Quezon City, Florida plies routes to 40-plus cities and towns in Ilocos, Cagayan Valley and the Cordillera Administrative Region. Manuel Baricaua, administrative chief of the LTO office in Region 2, said that the bus company might also have to answer allegations that it has been operating buses illegally, allegedly including those under Dagupan Bus Line and Cable Tours, the listed operator of the bus in the Bontoc accident. Last week, he led an inspection of about 40 buses parked at the Florida terminal in Tuguegarao City. LTO personnel found that at least 17 of the buses were in violation of franchise rules, such as switched license plates and unrecorded engine numbers, among other thing. Last month, the LTFRB canceled the operating license of Don Mariano Transit following an accident on the Skyway in which 18 persons were killed and more than a dozen others injured.

2014-02-12,,,,"MANILA -- Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) Chairman Francis Tolentino on Wednesday proposed that universities and colleges in Metro Manila adopt the distance learning system or ""open university"" scheme to ease traffic congestion in major thoroughfares. According to Tolentino, homeschooling program will allow students, especially those who are also working or living far from their schools, to study in the comfort of their homes and at their own time while not adding up to the traffic volume on the roads. Among the schools currently practicing distance learning include the University of the Philippines (UP), De La Salle University (DLSU), Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP), and Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila (PLM). ""I suggest that more school institutions in Metro Manila adopt this open university system as a traffic-alleviating measure. Our objective here is to reduce the number of students going out in the streets, especially during rush hours,"" Tolentino said in a statement. ""In an open university, you only have occasional face-to-face class sessions, you communicate through the Internet, so most of the time you only stay at your home. That's a big reduction to pedestrian, commuter, and vehicular volume,"" he added. He said schools may also want to transfer some of their students to their offsite or satellite campuses to lessen their student population in the metro. He noted that students living near satellite campuses, which are mostly located in the provinces, will greatly benefit from this system. ""Offsite campuses will help decongest student population in Metro Manila which, in turn, will redound to lesser volume of commuter, pedestrian, and vehicular volume in our road networks,"" Tolentino said. Those who have offsite campuses are the UP, PUP, DLSU, Lyceum of the Philippines, Mapua Institute of Science and Technology, Technological University of the Philippines (TUP), and Centro Escolar University, among others. The University of Sto. Tomas (UST), meanwhile, is set to open its new campus in General Santos City. The MMDA chief aired his proposals in light of the impending construction of 16 traffic infrastructure projects in the metro in the coming weeks. These are expected to cause serious traffic problems. The construction of Skyway Stage 3 will start on February 17, and will cut across the vicinity of 23 universities and colleges and several private and public elementary and secondary schools along its path from Gil Puyat Avenue in Makati City to Balintawak, Quezon City. Apart from Skyway Stage 3, 15 other infrastructure projects are lined up for construction:",,ABS-CBNnews.com,Metropolitan Manila Development Authority,yes,2014-02-12 00:00:00,reports on traffic congestion,,,,,,,,english,,http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/02/12/14/ease-traffic-mmda-suggests-open-university,,"metro manila, quezon city, makati, general santos, manila, quezon",text,,600.0,,85.0,,pia,,,traffic congestion,5.0,Straight News,,,,,,abs-cbnnews,no,,,,,"To ease traffic, MMDA suggests 'open university'",,,
2014-02-13,,,,"I was stuck in traffic the other day, and another day, and another day. Its the norm now, although unacceptable. It wont do. And it neednt do, if theres one simple thing: ACTION, instead of talk. What is needed is controlcontrol that would cost nothing except firm political will to enforce sensible traffic rules. Were stuck with the inadequate roads that are there, and the older ones that are acceptable. What arent, and what Im very angry about, are the new cities (past 20 years is new) that were blank pieces of ground where anything could have been donebut wasnt. Roads are narrow and there are intersections. Roads should be eight, even 10, lanes wide with over- or underpasses on all major intersections, or roundabouts in some cases. Traffic lights should be at a minimum, as unnecessary; malls and popular areas should have LARGE off-road areas for loading and unloading so normal traffic is not affected in any way. The so-called city planners and government officials should suffer Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Dutertes solution. Greed has dominated decisions. Sadly, whats done is done. But over- and underpasses can still be built at some critical intersectionsif the political will is there. I wish to devote this column to some simple, quick solutions that can help right now. The first is to hire hundreds of traffic aides, and TRAIN them in the art of keeping traffic flowing, with the power to enforce their directives. Given the ill-discipline and ignorance (how many drivers have actually passed a license exam?) of too many drivers, external control is essential until disciplined driving is second nature. Station 100, 200whatever is neededtraffic aides and cops all along Edsa to ensure that buses stay ONLY in the curbside lane and stop at designated bus stops. Take away the license of any bus driver outside the curbside lane, and ensure that intersections dont get blocked so cross traffic can flow and drivers dont cross lanes and push in for selfish advantage. All it needs is disciplined driving. It can be done. At peak hours, turn off the traffic lights, have INTELLIGENT (I have to stress that) cops maximizing intersection flow. So, top of the list: Keep intersections open. If you cant get through to the other side, you cant enter the box. The delays that a blocked intersection causes are horrific. Corollary to this is, let left-turning traffic through if your side is moving slowly so the other side can maintain a smooth flow. A block on the road doesnt just affect those nearby, it also has a strong cumulative affect that builds up. The other day we wanted to cross over SLEx from the airport to Bonifacio Global Citya couple of hundred meters, and it took 45 minutes. The problem was, cars entering into SLEx blocked the crossover; they couldnt clear the crossing but entered anyway. Beyond that the road was clear, and we were in BGC in 10 minutes. A perfect example of mindless selfishness, a perfect example of the need for a cop, or two. Or 10. Parking outside malls and schools should not be allowed, not even to drop off or pick up. That minute or so is enough to create substantial delays. The Virgin Mary Immaculate School in Alabang has cars two, sometimes three, lanes deep (leaving but one) as parents and drivers wait for the kids to emerge. Parking must be off-road; walking is good for kids (adults, too) anyway. In Australia, when theres an accident the vehicles must be immediately moved out of the traffic if possible. A picture is taken to provide needed detail. The other day a bus (of course) and an SUV had a minor bump coming down the ramp from the Skyway onto SLEx. The traffic buildup was over a kilometer because the vehicles stayed there while the drivers argued with the cops. Both vehicles were perfectly drivable. On that SLEx exit ramp that leads to Edsa, one thing Id do is put up a large live screen sufficiently ahead of the exit showing the traffic flow, or lack of it, on Edsa so you can choose to exit there or proceed further down. You dont have to add to the chaos. And that happens wherever a choice cant be made before entering a blind intersection. A reason for the chaos there, incidentally, is the lower gate to Dasma. Cars from the boulevard cross from the far left lane to get to it, stopping traffic flow. The solution is simple: Close that gate at peak hours. The few cars taking kids to school or whatever can drive an extra 200 meters to the main gate so thousands of other motorists arent disadvantaged. And now that were on Edsa, everyone agrees: TAKE HALF THE BUSES OFF IT. A study by the University of the Philippines and the Japan International Cooperation Agency has confirmed it. Why on earth hasnt it been done? The buses are half or less full, so half of them gone will disadvantage no commuter. I challenge our transport officials to take half the buses off Edsa before Holy Week. Who are we trying to look after, the public in millions or the bus owners in tens? And dont give me nonsense about franchises and things, Im sure it can be done. Half of the buses were probably fraudulently acquired anyway. And police them to stay only in the curbside at all times, absolutely no overtaking. And for the buses left, pay drivers a fixed salary so theres no temptation to rush for the next passenger. Bus service is a public service, not a profit-maximizing venture. As to trucks, get Subic and Batangas operating as planned, as alternate international ports. A successful city is where you take public transport by choice, where the system is so good you dont need, or even want, to use your car. We are far, far from that. So cars have to remain part of our city life, but lets get them moving. Its time we demanded one simple thing from government: ACTION. Just do it.

2014-02-13,,,,"MANILA, Philippines  An official of the Department of Public Works and Highways field office in Bontoc, Mountain Province, has dismissed as unbelievable the GV Florida Transports claim that poor road condition was to blame for the Feb. 7 fatal accident involving one of its buses, leaving 14 dead and 31 injured. DPWH District Engineer Wilbur Likigan told the Philippine Daily Inquirer its not true that poor road condition precipitated the accident. Contacted by phone, he pointed out that that portion of the Bontoc-Nueva Vizcaya road where the accident took place is well-maintained. We have a roving team of road sweepers who makes sure that the entire stretch of the road is free of sand particles, stones, rocks and other loose materials caused by landslides, he explained. And those sweepers do their assigned task regularly, said the DPWH official. He asserted its totally unfair to put the blame on the road condition. Were inclined to believe its either mechanical failure or the bus drivers error that may have caused the crash. Definitely not the road condition, he said, adding its unbelievable. On Wednesday, Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board chair Winston Ginez said that mechanical failure and the drivers negligence apparently led to the tragedy. The agency has slapped a 30-day suspension on all 228 units of the GV Florida Transport after discovering that the license plate of the ill-fated public utility vehicle belonged to a bus owned by another company, the Mountain Province Cable Tours (MPCT). Initial LTFRB investigation disclosed that the MPCT franchise and its buses were sold to GV Florida Transport in September 2013. Driver Edgar Renon, who survived the crash, and the owners of the firm, face charges of reckless imprudence resulting in multiple homicide and multiple physical injuries. Last Tuesday, the Philippine National Police regional office in Bontoc filed the criminal charges before the Mt. Province Prosecutors Office. The charges were based on affidavits of surviving victims of the accident and witnesses who claimed the bus was speeding along the sloping highway before it fell into the ravine.

2014-02-13,,,,"MANILA -- The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) is proposing a 4-day school week for elementary and high school students to reduce traffic as major construction projects start. The construction of the Skyway 3, which will connect the North Luzon Expressway (NLEX) with South Luzon Expressway (SLEX), will begin on Monday. According to MMDA, the average speed of 30 kilometers per hour along major roads in Manila could be cut in half because of heavy traffic. This means motorists and commuters will have to spend more time on the road just to get to their destinations. Around 23 schools in Metro Manila will be affected by the road projects, the MMDA said. To reduce the burden on students and help lessen the number of commuters on the streets, MMDA Chairman Francis Tolentino wants to change the 5-day school week to just 4 days. ""Lalong-lalo na yung mga schools na malapit sa construction site. Maging staggered yung pasukan, hindi sabay-sabay pumapasok, going at the same time to the same place,"" he said. He plans to discuss the proposal with the Department of Education (DepEd) officials. The MMDA earlier proposed a distance learning system for college and university students, as well as flexible working hours in companies and offices. However, some parents are opposed to the idea of reducing the number of school days, saying that the new schedule will affect their children's studies. With a shorter school week, students may learn less, according to parents interviewed by ABS-CBN News. It will also be more difficult for teachers who will have less time for their classes and lectures. Some colleges, like the Ateneo School of Government, are open to the suggestion, and would like to look at the benefits of the MMDA's proposal. According to DepEd assistant secretary for planning Jesus Mateo, they cannot implement a new policy without consulting stakeholders. ""Kailangan pag-aralan natin iyun. Hindi tayo magpapatupad ng polisiya na hindi natin kinokonsukta ang stakeholders. Kailangan natin pag-aralan iyung context. Iba iyung sitwasyon sa rural at iba sa urban.

2014-02-18,,,"Government agencies, Transport sector leaders","MANILA, PhilippinesHe promised to go back to Bontoc after his recovery. Dino Dimar, 25, one of the survivors of the wayward Florida bus that fell into a ravine in Bontoc town, Mt. Province and killed 15 people last Feb. 7 made this vow during an interview with INQUIRER.net at his hospital bedside. I will surely go back to Bontoc to thank the people there, Dimar said. The residents there, he said, were quick in responding to the crash site to help the injured victims. Dimar, who sustained a fracture in the collar bone and a swollen left leg, recounted the horror. On Feb. 6, he said he was travelling to Bontoc together with a circle of friends including David Sicam, who was with his wife, Abegail and two children. Unfortunately, Sicam was among the fatalities. According to him, he was invited by Sicam to join his family to celebrate his sons fourth birthday in Kalinga town in the Cordillera region. As an artist, David wanted to see the culture of Mt. Province and he wanted to give his son a memorable birthday celebration, he said. According to him, they left the bus terminal in Sampaloc, Manila at 8:15 p.m. on Thursday, Feb. 6. I was seated on the front seat just behind the driver. David, his wife and his two kids were also seated on the front seat on the conductors side, he said. On Friday morning, they had their last bus stop in a place, which according to him, is an hour away from Kalinga. It was 7:00 a.m., the sky was clear and there was no fog, he said disputing claims of the bus company that the accident was caused by miscalculation due to poor visibility caused by fog. Sitting just behind the driver, he said he had a clear view of everything. He remembered the bus was on a slow speed at about 15 kilometers per hour while negotiating downward curves and narrow roads. While on our way, I suddenly smelled something odd while the driver was working on what it seems was the emergency air break. It was like the smell of a burned rubber, which was immediately corrected by his seatmate Bam as the smell of the clutch burning he recalled. In just a few seconds, he said the bus was speeding at about 20 kilometers per hour. Our bus suddenly went wayward as it make its way through the curves, and the conductor, who perhaps knew what was going to happen, jumped off the bus, he said. He recounted that the driver tried to turn the bus towards the canal to avoid from falling into the ravine but he failed to do so. I knew the driver was aware that the bus has lost its ability to brake thats why he tried to turn the bus away from the ravine but he wasnt able to do so, he said. He recalled that one of the reserve drivers who were seated at the back most part of the bus shouted that the brakes were defective. People were screaming, others were praying and most of the people were panicking, he said. He said he saw David shouting, as he hugged and protected his son Amian who was on his lap. (Agung was held by his mother. Agung survived the accident with minor bruises and fractures. Amian survived unscathed.) He remembered, he told Bam Morillo, one of their companions, who was seated just beside him, to turn on his camera to record what was happening. Eventually they were hurled into the air as the bus went over the ravine. The roof of the bus was shorn off before the body of the bus came to a stop on the lower slope of the ravine. He said he was thrown out of the bus when its roof was detached due to a strong impact. I then found myself lying, facing the ground. I suddenly felt pain as I could not move my left leg. I found out that my left shoulder was badly hit, and had sustained a fracture, he said. But he said he remained calm and maintained presence of mind during those times. I told myself to relax. If I panic, nothing will happen, he said. He then turned his body so he could end up facing the sky so he can breathe properly. After he was able to turn his body, he then had a clear view of the crash site. I saw two of my friends, Charlie and Paeng, who were at a distance, slowly getting up, so I waved at them to signal that I was okay, he said. After that, he immediately reached for his phone and called his brother to tell him what happened. I called my brother to inform him about the accident and told him immediately that I am okay and need not to worry, he said. He mentioned that he instructed his brother to break the news to their parents for them not to worry and so they would not be shocked when the news of the accident will come out in the media. He said he also called his friend director Floy Quintos and another friend named Maye Padilla so they could send rescuers immediately to where they were. After that, he said he received a call from his father. I am alive. Dont worry, I am alive, he said to his father over the phone. When the rescuers arrived, they asked me how I was and then immediately placed me on a stretcher, he said. He was rushed to Bontoc General Hospital and was airlifted the following day to the Notre Dame Hospital in Baguio City. On Monday, Feb. 10, he was airlifted to Manila and was confined at the St. Lukes Medical Center in Quezon City. As of posting time, he is still in the hospital for medical treatment. I now have a deeper understanding of the word miracle. I was given a second chance because I knew I still have a purpose to accomplish, he said. He said he was thankful for the locals in Bontoc noting that three to ten minutes after the accident, they were already there. He also mentioned that none of his belongings was lost, and it was enough proof of the honesty of the locals there. He said the accident would not prevent him from pursuing his passion for culture and the arts. I became friends with David because we share the same interest, he said saying the loss of David was very painful because he was like a brother to him. He added, I need to conquer my fear of riding a bus, saying his next bus ride will be his trip to Bontoc to thank the people who helped them during the accident. Dimar told INQUIRER.net that his family and the other victims would file a formal criminal case against Florida Bus Co. He said he wanted the bus company to have a complete list of the passengers to keep track of what happened to them and where they are now so they can help all the survivors and the family of the victims. I hope everybody is extended help because its painful, very painful. We should be vigilant. We cannot afford another accident that would claim the lives of people, said Dimar, an employee of Hinge Inquirer Publications, a member of the Inquirer Group of Companies that include INQUIRER.net. He added that the accident should be a wakeup call for the Land Transportation and Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to investigate not only Florida but all bus companies that may be operating illegally and with bus units that are not road worthy. The LTFRB issued a 30-day preventive suspension against all the 228 Florida bus units. The LTFRB also said the ill-fated bus, with plate number TXT-872, was not authorized to operate. Its engine and chassis number were different from the ones listed under the plate numbers Certificate of Registration filed at the Land Transportation Office (LTO). On Feb. 10, Mt. Province police filed reckless imprudence resulting in multiple homicide and multiple physical injuries against the bus company and its driver, Edgar Renon who also survived the crash and has since left the hospital. Aside from David Sicam, the accident also claimed the life of popular comedian Arvin Tado Jimenez.

LTFRB Chairman Winston Ginez asked transport groups to file an urgent motion about the provisional increase and copy furnish all other parties in the case including the Office of the Solicitor General, which represents the government, Roberto Concepcion of Oil Price Watch, and Elvira Medina of the consumers' group. This is for the other parties to be able to give their comments and suggestions on the 50-centavo increase.

2014-02-17,,,,"MANILA - The monstrous traffic jams expected in the next two years is not only because of the road networks that will be put in place. According to Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) Francis Tolentino, a slew of projects will be held in the next few months from water pipe replacements to truck bans that will slow down vehicles plying EDSA and other major roads. In an interview with ANC, Tolentino said the traffic mess this morning was because of the advance info given, several motorists shifted from Osmea Highway to EDSA. Coupled with the morning rush, this is it. The government had earlier asked the public for patience because of the construction projects that will start later today. Based on an advisory from the Citra Central Expressway Corp., the group that will undertake the P26 billion Skyway 3 project, an advance work site will be set up later at 10:00 p.m. at the center island of Osmea Highway from Buendia in Makati to Quirino Ave in Manila. The Skyway 3 project, a 14.8 kilometer six-lane elevated expressway, will complete the Skyway system from Alabang to Balintawak. The project is targeted for completion before 2016. Another project, the Ninoy Aquino International Airport Expressway Phase 2, also begins today. Both projects are expected to increase traffic volume in EDSA. MMDA already put up a website that the public can access to check on the completion status of a total of 15 road projects. Theres also a plan by the [Maynilad Water Services, Inc.] to upgrade their pipe system, Tolentino said. He said this will take four and a half months. The truck ban that will be implemented by the city of Manila may also add to the burden of motorists, he said. While Manila will have hassle-free traffic because of the lack of trucks plying its roads by day, it will be different the rest of the day. Pagdating sa gabi, bubuhos sila. Kasagsagan pa ng construction, he said. Of course, there are also the road accidents that delay further the movement of traffic. Tolentino said there is an average of 22 accidents on EDSA every day. Last Friday, Valentines Day and payday, there were 24 accidents recorded there, he said. Tolentino said the government is doing its best to deal with the monstrous traffic. Several suggestions have already been put forward, including the four-day school week and No Green Plate Day. On Monday, cyclists, environmentalists and doctors trooped to the Supreme Court to compel the government to share the road network for bicycle lanes and walkways. The Share the Road Movement asked the high court to direct the government to divide the roads in half: half for cars and half for collective transport systems, like all-weather bike lanes and sidewalks, bus rapid transit, and public trains. The petition reads: Car ownership in the country is very disproportionate. Only 2 percent (2%) of our people own motor vehicles. However, the majority of the roads are given to them. The government policy has been to build more and more roads to accommodate more and more private vehicles. The remaining ninety-eight per cent (98%) of the population are not even given enough space to walk on.

2014-02-17,,,Government agencies,"The P26.5-billion Skyway Stage 3 project will only alleviate the traffic situation in Metro Manila but will not solve it, an architect and urban planner said Monday.  The more roads you put, the more cars you attract kaya it will never be enough if you (build more roads), Felino Palafox Jr said in a phone interview with GMA News TV's ""Balita Pilipinas"" on Monday.   It is expected to complete the Metro Manila Skyway system from Alabang to Balintawak.  The project will link Skyway Stage 1 at Buendia and through the junction of Osmea Highway and Quirino Ave. towards Plaza Dilao, cross the Pasig River, then cut through behind SM Sta. Mesa towards G. Araneta Ave. From there, it will cross Aurora Blvd., E. Rodriguez and Quezon Ave. towards Sgt. E. Rivera and on through A. Bonifacio towards Balintawak.    The 14.8-kilometer, elevated expressway is envisioned to decongest traffic in Metro Manila, especially on C4 (EDSA), C5 (CP Garcia) and in Central Metro Manila and cut travel time from Buendia to Balintawak to 20 minutes, Makati to Quezon to 15 minutes; Makati to Manila to 10 minutes, and Makati to Sta. Mesa to 5 minutes.  Palafox said the government should focus on pedestrians instead of automobiles, an approach that other countries have already taken.  The Number 1 priority now is walking, pedestrians. Pangalawa is bicycle. Pangatlo is public transit like buses, LRT (Light Railway Transit), MRT (Metro Railway Transit), monorails and so on. Last priority yung automobile, he said.  He cited how New York widened its roads to accommodate bicycle lanes while other elevated structures also have a lane where pedestrians can bike or walk.    Palafox said the government should not focus on road or traffic engineering alone but also take into consideration land use and density, transportation planning, traffic engineering and traffic management.  Ang nangyayari sa mga kalye natin, nagdedesign lang [ay] mga road engineers, walang input ang urban planners, walang input ang landscape architect. Kaya maraming road widening ngayon [na] maski 100-year-old yung puno, pinuputol, he said.  Kung kinonsulta ang mga urban planners o landscape architect, pwedeng traffic island yung 100-year old tree and the other side of the tree pwedeng pang bisikleta, slow moving vehicles, he added.  He said the country does not have a comprehensive, integrated and interdisciplinary approach in road management.  Palafox further said that the government should maximize the railway system.  Sa MRT, kulang tayo ng train. I'm told in the past 14 years walang nadagdag na trains. Tignan mo yung rail tracks ng EDSA, it can accommodate more trains, he said.  He also said that Pasig River should be utilized as it is the transportation corridor between Manila Bay and Laguna [de Bay]. Kasing haba yan ng EDSA.  We have missed a lot of opportunities kasi hindi lang naman good governance (ang mahalaga). Successful cities in the world have number one, political will with visionary leadership; two, good planning; and three, good governance.

2014-02-17,,,"Public officials, Government agencies","A resounding yes to Peter Wallaces question: Been stuck in traffic lately? (Opinion, 2/13/14) If only the concerned government officials would heed Wallaces suggestions, I am pretty sure our unbearable traffic condition would greatly improve. Heavy traffic in Metro Manila has become an ordinary event. I wonder what the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) is doing to address this chronic plague. How about the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board and the concerned local government units? Couldnt government tap other agencies to help solve the traffic mess? As a daily commuter from Quezon City to Makati City, I have tried all routes and means of transportation available just to be at my workplace on time. For the 8 a.m. call time in Makati, I have to be out of our house at six. Thats a cool, precious two-hour allowance for travel. Going home is another two-hour ride (at least) through fumes and all. I would call it a lucky day if I get home before 9 p.m. The word horrendous is not an accurate description of the daily traffic in the city. Travel via the Metro Rail Transit and the Light Rail Transit sounds good, but the long lines of commuters are disgusting. Getting a ride during peak hours takes an hour. Being pushed and squeezed in the process is insult added to injury. Travelling during peak hours via Edsa is neither advisable. It seems all types of vehicles pass Edsa. MMDA men, who are supposed to help ease the congestion, are of no help. Undisciplined drivers, especially bus drivers, get on with their merry ways despite the CCTVs. Many times, I have taken the risk of taking colorum vans either from Quezon Avenue or from Espaa, Manila. I know the danger of riding in these unregistered passenger vehicles, but I am left with no choice. (I cant afford taking a taxicab to Makati every day.) I pity the drivers when they are harassed by greedy traffic enforcers and policemen. Yes, they are not supposed to pick up passengers without the required government permit. But does our government offer ways to legalize them? In one of my bus rides via Edsa, I heard our driver offering sensible suggestions to solve the worsening traffic along Edsa. I likewise hear wise opinions from jeepney drivers whenever they are stuck in traffic. Are there forums held to get suggestions from these men who have spent a good part of their lives on the road? And is there a way to regulate or limit the number of cars on our roads, which are now overloaded? Something must be done to address the worsening traffic mess in our metropolis. The problem speaks badly about our country. How could we talk of progress when we cant even solve our traffic problem?

2014-02-17,,,,"Were screwed until 2016.   Brace for it. No pain, no gain, the project proponents are saying. But is it really the most brilliant idea to undergo possibly up to thirteen different projects that will clog up Metro Manila all at the same time?  From a personal, everyday perspective, one small thing can lead to a doubling of commute time. When I travel from home to work, my average travel time is 20 minutes. If I go early morning its as little as five, but all it takes is one thing to happen and all that goes tumbling down the drain.  I cross EDSA from Timog to East Ave. This intersection is where buses from East Ave. go onto EDSA. What they do when they are being dicks (and they often are) is they will jam up EDSA so that all traffic crossing it comes to a halt. Even when there is no space for the bus to get on to EDSA, if they see an opening they will surge forward and block up routes just to get position for themselves when traffic might open up.  At this intersection there is an MMDA outpost. Sometimes there are MMDA officers trying to fix the traffic. Often there arent.  I am writing this on a Saturday when I have cancelled all of my plans. Earlier in the week there were plans released that a religious sect would be conducting a , and this would probably lock down traffic. Ive been a victim of this sects previous events. When they held a , it tied up traffic all around Quezon City Circle and my 20-minute commute turned into a two-hour ordeal. I could only expect the worst if they had plans of marching through major thoroughfares for the day. Whatever their noble cause might be, I cant help but think theres got to be some better, more considerate way to go about it.  These small situations lead to in the traffic situation. What more can we expect when the major projects roll around and there will be key thoroughfares shut down? Granted, there will supposedly be alternate routes. But how helpful will these alternate routes be?  And I do appreciate that we need infrastructure improved all over Metro Manila. Thats a given. But is it really the wisest thing to do it all at once? To have nine to 13 areas under construction?  Would it be better if they co-ordinated the execution of these? Now, I dont know, and I could be wrong here, and it is totally necessary that all these occur at once. But was this planned? Was this a considered decision to execute all at once?  I think one problem here is a lack of information and a weak pleading. We are being told that there will be traffic. We are being told that in 2016 things will be better. But by better I assume just not as bad as, well, right now. Not essentially traffic running smoothly and efficiently.    Weve been asked to have patience. But when you ask for someones patience, you should explain the process. Instead were just being told to put up with the traffic until its done. And weve got no say in it whatsoever. This is happening whether we want it to or not.  We arent being given any options either. Sure roads will be re-routed. Id feel much better if public transportation were being made more efficient. But as longer lines to get on trains indicate, its getting worse there too. Any medium of transportation we choose, whether its driving our own cars, trains, buses, or jeeps, were screwed.  How much manpower and how much morale will be lost to this traffic. Those extra hours of commuting time could obviously be spent on better things.  How crappy do you feel when you get to work after slogging through traffic? When you head home, what else can you do after braving it? I know that we will have to deal with this situation very soon. But I wish that we didnt have to. I am hoping that solutions can be found to address this. I doubt the current suggestions, such as changing school schedules down to four days, are going to work.  I dont want to hear about being patient and about being understanding. What I really want to hear is a plan that makes sense. I hope we get one soon.

2014-02-18,,,Congress,"MANILA, PhilippinesThe prospect of hellish traffic jams in Metro Manila with two major road projects beginning simultaneously on Monday night has prompted a Quezon City lawmaker to revive his push for a four-day work week for government employees to help ease the anticipated gridlock. Quezon City Rep. Winston Castelo, who chairs the House committee on Metro Manila development, said his proposal would reduce the commuting time for state employees and provide a measure of comfort by giving them an extra day off. This is especially important now in light of the looming traffic jams expected to result from the construction of the Skyway project to connect South Luzon Expressway on Gil Puyat Avenue in Makati City to the North Luzon Expressway in Balintawak, Quezon City, and the construction of Ninoy Aquino International Airport Expressway Phase 2 to the Entertainment City gambling hub. To make up for the extra nonworking day, government workers would have to work for 10 hours a day instead of the usual eight hours, according to Castelo. The 10-hour, four-day work week complements a recent proposal from traffic officials to limit school days from five to four days a week as well. Our workers serve as our economic backbone. We should not close our eyes to their difficulties, especially now that major infrastructure projects are on their way for their construction, Castelo told reporters on Monday. At no better time than now when megaroad projects in Metro Manila have gotten under way that proactive experimentation should take place, he added. The House has long been observing the four-day work week, Castelo said, and this has resulted in government savings, among other things. He said the cutback had not compromised service or productivity. The lawmaker said his bill, if approved, could lead to 20-percent in savings in work expenses, such as transportation fare and food for the state employees. Employers, on the other hand, could save on maintenance costs and overtime pay for workers. The shortened work week could also lead to better productivity because it would help workers to be more focused on their tasks, he said. The extra rest day would give government workers more time to spend with their families or pursue leisure activities, and this could make them more revitalized and motivated, Castelo said. They could even use the additional day off to hone their skills so that they would be more competitive in the labor market, he added. Castelo said he decided to refile his bill in the 16th Congress even before the megaroad projects took off because he had observed that many workers were being stressed out by worsening daily traffic and becoming less productive. Members of the House independent bloc said they would invite public works, traffic and other officials involved in the 14.8-kilometer Skyway project to a hearing to provide details of the impending road works. Leyte Rep. Ferdinand Martin Romualdez said having more in-depth data about the major road projects would help Congress come up with ways to mitigate the effects of the road works. Romualdez said this should not be taken as opposition to progress. We wish it wouldve come earlier so were stuck with a much delayed and last-minute project, he said. He also said the public should know how much the toll would be once the Skyway extension is completed because this could also lead to increased fares and trigger a demand for higher salaries. Residents of the capital went through the usual traffic snarls that would likely worsen in the coming years as the Aquino administration belatedly implements 15 infrastructure projects. We are informing the general public to brace for the traffic situation that we will be encountering for the next four years, Francisco Manalo, executive director of the capitals traffic office, said as angry commuters took to social media to vent their frustrations. Manalo warned that once construction begins, travel on the citys main roads will be reduced to a crawling speed of 1 to 9 kilometers per hour, compared to the already slow, normal 20 kph. Motorists and commuters fearful of getting stuck on the roads left home earlier than usual on Monday. But with so many vehicles on the road as the day began, traffic in and around Manila was snarled for hours in the morning. Traffic armageddon begins in Manila!! tweeted San Crisselle Tiu, while Chay1007 said she had to bring an extra [supply] of patience. Once actual construction begins, it can take a vehicle at least two hours to travel the 19-km stretch of the citys main thoroughfare, warned Vicente Lizada, spokesman for the Metropolitan Manila Development Authoritys traffic monitoring office. The authority has asked contractors to provide staff to help direct traffic. RELATED STORIES",Leila B.

2014-02-18,,,,"MANILA  The Metro Manila Development Authority said on Monday that it is advocating the use of alternative modes of transportation as a way to decongest traffic. Ang mga minumungkahi natin ay alternative modes of transport gumamit po tayo ng mga tren, bisiketa, maglakad tayo, at yung pinapanukala ni Chairman (Francis Tolentino) na gamitin natin ang mga waterways para mag-move ng people, Atty Emerson Carlos, assistant general manager of the MMDA, said. Carlos also said they are also urging people with own vehicles to make use of public transport. Isa sa mga ina-advocate din natin ay ang gumamit ng public transport ang may mga sasakyan para magkaroon ng konting paggalaw sa construction period na ito, he said. According to Carlos, one of the major projects of the MMDA is putting up more bicycle lanes apart from the existing ones at EDSA from Magallanes to Ayala, along Marcos Highway and at Commonwealth Avenue. Carlos said that these 15 or 16 road projects are vital in decongesting traffic in the city. Sabi nga nila, no pain no gain. Talagang kailangan natin ang mga proyektong ito. Kung di natin gagawin hindi luluwag ang trapiko. Hindi naman po siguro pwedeng status quo lang tayo, he said. Studies say that Metro Manila needs a road network of 8,000 kilometers, Carlos said. But we only have 5,000. Itong mga projects na ito, although hindi aabot ng 3,000 kilometers agad-agad ay vital projects ang mga ito, he added. Although there would be a slowing down in the mobility of goods and transport, Carlos said this would change after the projects have been completed.

2014-03-06,,,,"I would like to thank Neal Cruz for keeping the conversation about the state of public transportation in Metro Manila alive (Too many vehicles, too few streets, Opinion, 2/7/14). We truly need a more efficient way to move millions of people around the Metro. Other big cities can do it, why cant we? Basically, with a light rail system of commuter trains with stops supported by a network of buses and jeepneys that run on set schedules and drop people off at designated stops. And, as Cruz suggested, with a river ferry system that runs in conjunction with the bus and train schedules. Why cant we have one Metro Manila system of transportation that is truly useful and user friendly? Passenger buses and jeepneys are to blame (in a big way!) for the hell that is the Metro Manila commute. Old vehicles not fit for use in other countries and gaudy ragtag jeepneys (Id take function over decoration any day) that stop wherever/whenever are a big cause of the congestion. Breathe in the acrid air of Metro Manila, then look and see where all that bad air is coming from: mostly from smoke-belching buses and jeepneys that pinch pennies in vehicle maintenance for bigger profits. And speaking of profits, lets not forget the drivers competing for passengers, in the process wreaking havoc on the flow of traffic with sometimes lethal consequences. I drove along Alabang-Zapote road the other day. While sitting in traffic, I witnessed a pedestrian snatch a purse from a lady inside a jeepney. I almost got into an accident when a bus swerved onto my lane after picking up passengers and, at another time, when a jeepney swerved haphazardly to drop off some fares. Throngs of pedestrians were crossing the road under an overpass and on streets with little or no sidewalk. That 45-minute drive was chaotic, loud, dangerous and dirty. The phrase gates of hell came to my mind a few times. Leaving the country and seeing how easy it is for people to live and work in cities like New York, San Francisco, London, Berlin, Tokyo, Singapore, I am appalled at how our public transportation system is run. I know we are not a First World country, but cant we aspire to those standards? Even Bangkok is many, many years ahead of us in this respect with their monorails and cleaner tuk-tuks. Look at the faces of the commuters riding the jeepneys or buses, or squished inside MRT coaches to see how much misery accompanies the daily commute. And we question the productivity of our workforce? It is no wonder why people wont ditch their cars. I wouldnt, not now, at least. Kris was news when she had to ride the MRT. In other countries politicians often use the public transport system. Which shows how efficient and user-friendly it is, and that peoples taxes are being put to good use. A major commitment by our government, a major investment, a major involvement by the people of Metro Manila, a major overhaul of our public transportation are all we need to achieve that major change in the quality of life in Metro Manila. Without these, all we will have would be patchwork improvements, much like what are being done with jeepney maintenance. ERWIN A.

2014-02-18,,,,"MANILA  With traffic expected to worsen due to the start of the construction of Skyway 3 and other big road projects, netizens were asked whether a petition filed before the Supreme Court on sharing road space will help ease traffic. On Monday, TV Patrol asked its social media users on Facebook and Twitter the question, Tingin mo ba, malulutas ng paglagay ng bike lanes at pagdagdag ng sidewalks ang problema sa trapik? The replies were mixed, but most were positive about the change road projects will bring. A number of netizens said being patient with the construction of roads will eventually pay off. Rhea Baluyot said that its a sacrifice that everyone must endure for the meantime. Sana magsakripisyo nalang ang lahat at tama na muna ang reklamo.

2014-02-19,,,,"MANILA, Philippines - Speaker Feliciano Belmonte Jr. is open to various proposals to ease traffic in Metro Manila due to various road projects. Speaking to reporters, Belmonte said all ways to minimize traffic jams must be exhausted before any of the proposals would be tried, including a 10-hour, four-day workweek for government employees and a four-day school week. Im open to these (proposals). Theres this four-day workweek and even a four-day school week, he said. There are existing measures we can enforce and there are side roads that we can use (to avoid heavy traffic. Belmonte said local governments, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority, and the Philippine National Police must strictly enforce traffic rules and regulations. Motorists, commuters and all concerned must also exercise discipline when traveling within Metro Manila, he added. Earlier, Quezon City Rep. Winston Castelo urged the government to consider implementing a 10-hour, four-day workweek in government offices to enable workers to cope with traffic in Metro Manila. He said he has re-filed a bill seeking to implement a Monday-to-Friday work schedule for public sector employees as traffic jams are expected to worsen as a result of the construction of the 14.8 kilometer Skyway-Stage 3 project and two other major infrastructure projects in the metropolis. The proposed 10/4 work schedule could complement the four-day school schedule on all levels of education, he added. Castelo said solving traffic woes must not be confined to limiting school days, but must extend to creative approaches to provide some comfort for the working class. Our workers serve as our economic backbone, he said. We should not close our eyes to their difficulties, especially now that major infrastructure projects are under construction. Castelo said the 10/4 workweek could mean weekly savings of at least 20 percent in work expenses. It can even serve as a poverty alleviation program by itself for cash-strapped workers, he added.  Paolo Romero, Delon Porcalla, Mayen Jaymalin Malacaang yesterday urged motorists and commuters to adopt ways to cope with heavy traffic. Speaking to reporters, Presidential Communications Operations Office Secretary Herminio Coloma Jr. said these could be carpooling, company flexi-time and home office arrangements. We would rather focus for now on the voluntary measures because these are more effective and involve what the concerned parties want to do, he said. Coloma called again on the people to share in the sacrifice and bear with the short-term inconvenience. So we can reap the benefits of faster travel and higher productivity, he said. Coloma said the government had long considered several remedial measures based on advance information reaching the Department of Public Works and Highways and the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority. This is a continuing process undertaken by the government through the MMDA, local governments and DPWH, he said. Coloma said the government is getting enough support from stakeholders. I think we should also recognize that many of our people are willing to do the necessary sacrifice that is needed and they are willing to bear with the inconvenience, he said. This is not the first time we had issues involving major projects like this. The Employers Confederation of the Philippines (ECOP) rejected yesterday a proposal for a four-day workweek to ease traffic in Metro Manila. ECOP president Edgardo Lacson said the proposal could adversely affect the countrys competitiveness and economy. Fewer working days will further worsen the productivity of workers and lessen their earnings, he added. The government should instead issue traffic guidelines and allow companies to make the necessary adjustments, Lacson said. The Partido ng Manggagawa (PM) also raised concerns that the 4-day workweek could negatively affect small and medium enterprises (SMEs) nationwide. PM spokesman Wilson Fortaleza said reducing work days will not lessen the volume of vehicles on the streets as most ordinary workers do not own vehicles. The proposal to cut the workers volume on a particular day of a week, however, is based on the plain assumption that no work would mean less vehicles on the streets, which is wishful thinking when the city is ruled by private vehicles, he said. Fortaleza said the productivity and survival of SMEs rely on daily sales of goods and services. While flexible working hours is allowed under the law, it should not likewise result to the reduction or diminution of workers benefits, specifically on the provision of overtime pay above the mandatory 8-hour work day, he said. Fortaleza said the proposal might lead to legalizing the non-payment of overtime. The proposal to clear off the roads might end up punishing the poor, he said. Fortaleza said a four-day workweek is not the solution to the traffic problem in Metro Manila. We are more in favor of developing mass transport systems particularly railways, rather than building more road networks that largely serve the comfort of private car owners, he said."," Paolo Romero, Delon Porcalla, Mayen Jaymalin",The Philippine Star,Congress,yes,2014-02-19 00:00:00,"formulation of legislationlocal ordinances,reports on traffic congestion,traffic congestions solutions",,,,,,,,english,,http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/02/18/14/belmonte-open-proposals-traffic-decongestion,,"manila, metro manila, quezon, quezon city",text,,289.0,,1640.0,,mavie,,,"policy and legislation, traffic congestion",6.0,Straight News,,,,,,abs-cbnnews,no,,,,,Belmonte open to proposals on traffic decongestion,Neutral,,
2014-02-19,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesHoping to ease the monstrous traffic jams once the governments construction projects begin, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) plans to hire another 400 traffic enforcers this year. MMDA Chair Francis Tolentino told reporters in an interview on Wednesday, that the agency would be accepting applications for 400 traffic enforcer posts especially in the last quarter of the year. The new enforcers will be assigned to areas affected by the 15 construction works about to start this year. The agency presently has 2,000 traffic enforcers spread out in the metropolis. Acting as force multiplier, the enforcers, however would not be given the power to apprehend traffic violators and to issue citation tickets, Tolentino said. Apart from the MMDA traffic constables, private contractors are required to deploy at least 50 flagmen to assist in the traffic flow. The two construction projectsSkyway 3 project and the NAIA Expressway Phase 2have begun this week. Other projects set to begin in the next few months are the Gil Puyat-Makati-Avenue-Paseo de Roxas underpass; Sta. Monica-Lawton Avenue bridge; CP Garcia Avenue-McKinley Hill ramp; repair and asphalt overlay of Magallanes Interchange; EDSA-Taft Avenue flyover; MRT Line 3/ LRT Line 1 extension common station; LRT Line 2 East extension up to Masinag; LRT Line 1 Extension (Cavite); EDSA- Roosevelt Ave. interchange; Espaa Avenue-Lacson Avenue interchange; repair and rehabilitation and improvement of South Superhighway Makati; the NLEX-SLEX connector road; and the EDSA-West Avenue-North Avenue interchange.

2014-02-21,,,,"On the brink of death, aspiring filmmaker Christian ""Mylo"" Cabardo had the presence of mind to crawl through a ghastly crash scene to record lifeless fellow passengers and wounded friends crying for help. In a video and in photos released to GMA News by Cabardo's family, the late artist was able to document the situation on the ground minutes after the bus operated by GV Florida fell into a deep ravine in Bontoc, Mt. Province on February 7. Cabardo was even able to take photos of his bloodied face and legs, GMA News' ""24 Oras"" reported Friday. Cabardo was reportedly using a different camera during the trip but he lost hold of it as the bus fell down the slope. As survivors wailed in pain, Cabardo crawled, himself suffering from serious injuries, to get another camera in his bag. ""That's the time na sabi niya, I need the other camera in my bag. Kailangan kong picturan lahat ng ito, kailangan ko ma-document lahat,"" said Cabardo's brother, Chris Mark. ""Tumatakbo sa isip niya somehow na kung hindi ko ma-survive itokasi nga in pain yung brother ko at that timesabi niya, kailangan makita ng mga tao kung gano ka-grabe yung accident,"" he added. The original camera that Cabardo used to document the crash as it happened can no longer be found, ""24 Oras"" report said. He had been recording as the driver tried to control the speeding, brakeless bus before it fell over the edge. Cabardo's mother, Estrella, meanwhile narrated the incident based on her last conversation with her son before he was airlifted by the military from Bontoc to Manila a day after the incident. ""Sabi niya (Mylo), 'Nag sho-shoot ako ng marinig ko na sumisigaw ang driver na 'wala na tayong preno, wala na tayong preno!' Tapos may narinig siyang sumisigaw na ibangga mo sa pader, ibangga mo sa pader, tapos after that parang lumipad na raw sila,"" Estrella narrated. Cabardo underwent an operation in Manila but died on February 9 from complications. Estrella, who rushed to Bontoc after the incident, said her son even showed her the photos he took after the incident. ""Mommy, nakita ko si Tado patay, nakita ko si David (Sicam) patay. Eto, mommy, yung pinicturan ko, pinicturan ko pati sarili ko. Ayun, pinakita niya lahat sa 'kin yun (photos),"" Estrella narrated of their last conversation. Cabardo was already dead when Estrella arrived at the hospital after commuting back from Bontoc to Manila by bus. ""Sabi nila ganun daw ang buhay, kaya lang ang sakit pala, ang hirap pala mawalan ng anak... Maya't-maya naaalala ko siya,"" Estrella said. Chris Mark meanwhile noted his brother's uncanny way of thinking. ""For a normal person, ang first na maiisip mo is to cry for help... Pero siya hindi... grabe talaga siya, ito pa rin yung naisip, to tell a story to us kung ano ang nangyari,"" Chris Mark said. A fine arts graduate of Philippine Women's University, Cabardo worked as a graphic artist and events coordinator at several advertising companies. Cabardo was also a tattoo artist and was on his way to Bontoc with tattoo business owner Marcial Baranda Jr. and other artists. Their group was supposed to give lectures to tribal tattoo artists about safe tattoo practices. Baranda also died in the crash. Cabardo was set to get married this year to his girlfriend of seven years.

2014-02-21,,,,"MANILA - Transport groups ACTO (Alliance of Concerned Transport Organizations) and ALTODAP (Alliance of Transport Operators and Drivers Association of the Philippines) will implement a provisional 50 centavo jeepney fare increase on March 8, with or without government approval. ACTO President Efren de Luna said operators are simply taking back a voluntary rollback implemented in 2008. Fellow transport leader Boy Vargas of ALTODAP said he supports the plan. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) continued hearing today the P2 fare hike petition previously filed by transport groups due to fuel price increases. This time, however, transport groups are presenting additional reasons for the hike. 1-UTAK chairman Atty. Vigor Mendoza said major infrastructure and road projects in Metro Manila will greatly affect the transport sector. They also expressed deep concern over the proposed 4-day school week which shall cause a P50-100 loss of income to jeepney drivers. LTFRB Chairman Winston Ginez warned that they will sanction those who will adjust fares without approval. Ginez said the issue on traffic due to road projects and the impact of the 4-day school week have yet to be seen. He also assured transport groups that the rerouting map currently being designed by the government will not affect routes of public utility vehicles since it will focus on the rerouting of private cars. The LTFRB still needs to conduct at least 3 more hearings before they can issue a final decision on the jeepney fare hike petition. The National Council for Commuters Safety and Protection (NCCSP) contradicted the claim of ACTO and ALTODAP that the 50-centavo rollback in 2008 was voluntary. NCCSP President Elvira Medina said the rollback in 2008 was due to a petition that their group filed, and they will do everything to stop the fare hike on March 8.",,"By Zen Hernandez, ABS-CBN News",,yes,2014-02-21 00:00:00,jeepney minimum fare,,,,,,,,english,,http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/02/21/14/groups-force-50-centavo-jeepney-fare-hike,,"metro manila, manila",text,,788.0,,1441.0,,pia,,,jeepney fare,4.5,Straight News,,,,,,abs-cbnnews,no,,,,,Groups to force 50-centavo jeepney fare hike,,,
2014-02-21,,,,"Only a nitwit will schedule 17 road projects (another two were added to the first 15) in a metropolis that has long been suffering from monstrous traffic jams brought about by too many vehicles on too few streets. Couldnt the government have spaced the projects so that not all 17 will diminish the inadequate road space? Couldnt it have first prepared alternative means of transport? Couldnt it have found a way to reduce the number of vehicles on the streets? Couldnt it have improved the mass transit system first? Couldnt it have considered the additional suffering that it would impose on the people? Couldnt it have prepared the people much earlier? But no. The government surprised the public with the announcement on the eve of the start of the projects. Instead of trying to find ways to ease the traffic congestion, it asked the people to make sacrifices for a short period as the projects would make traveling faster in the future. For a short period? Is three years a short period to crawl on the streets of Metro Manila every day? Imagine the trillions of pesos that the economy will lose in those three years. The Japan International Cooperation Agency has estimated that the economy loses P2.4 billion every day because of the lost work hours and business opportunities, and the tremendous amount of expensive fuel burned by the vehicles crawling through the traffic. Imagine the pollution that these vehicles spew into the atmosphere every minute of the day and night. Why didnt the government space out the projects instead of bunching these together? Because it wants to finish all the projects before P-Noy bows out in 2016. It dawdled during the first three years, and now that the Aquino administration is on its last two minutes, it crams everything in that short period. It wants P-Noy to be able to crow about his achievements when he bows out, earning the gratitude and adulation of the people. Does the government think the people would be grateful and loving after being made to suffer for three years? By that time, the people would be so exasperated and angry that they would be cursing P-Noy. The Metro Manila Development Authority, which is in charge of traffic in the metropolis, could do nothing but tell the people to find alternative routes to avoid the expected traffic jams. What alternative routes? In the metropolis there is no such thing. All the streets of Metro Manila are heavily congested. Every day I try to find an alternative route to Makati and back to Quezon City, to no avail. The alternative routes suggested by the MMDA, being narrower, are even more congested than the main streets. And parked vehicles make these narrow streets even more so. Only a few days before the start of the projects, the MMDA held a traffic summit during which it asked for suggestions on how to ease the traffic congestion. Among the suggestions were a four-day school week, a four-day work week, and the revival of the Pasig River ferry. What would a four-day school and work week do? Nothing, except make the government workers happy but the general public unhappy because it would get even less service (already deficient during five-day or even six-day work weeks) from government employees. Private employers would be unhappy, too, because they would get less productivity from their employers. Schoolchildren will learn even less because of the reduced school days. They already lose plenty of learning time during the rainy season and frequent holidays; they would lose even more because one more day would be deducted from their class hours. But would it reduce the traffic jams? I dont think so. Traffic will remain the same during the four-day work and school week. In fact, the congestion will be even longer because workers and students will go home later. During the three-day weekend, the freed employees and students, with nothing to do, will crowd the shopping malls and traffic would be just as heavy. The revival of the Pasig River ferry is a good idea, but it should have been started much earlier. How long would it take to procure the needed ferry boats? Preparing for the bidding for suppliers alone would take a year, and the procurement and delivery of the boats would take another year, considering the notorious slowness of the government in doing such things. Look at the planned procurement of more trains and coaches and a faster ticketing system for the elevated trainsthese have been delayed again because losing bidders have a penchant for going to court and judges have a penchant for issuing restraining orders. More trains, coaches, and trips for the LRT-MRT would have allowed the people to get somewhere even with the traffic jams. But now it would take at least a year to determine the winning bidder, considering the even more notorious slowness of our courts: at least six months for the bidder to place the orders, at least another year for the factory to make the trains and coaches, and still another year to complete the deliveries. A few days ago, I read that the local car manufacturers sold more cars than the previous year. A day later, I read that car importers have also increased sales. Where are we going to put all of those vehicles when the number of our streets is not increasing as fast as the number of vehicles? The day is not far off when Metro Manila will become one huge parking lot. So what can be done quickly? Remove all obstructions on the streets like parked vehicles and sidewalk vendors. Cut the number of buses plying Edsa. Limit car ownership in Metro Manila, as is being done in Tokyo and New York.",Neal H.

2014-02-22,,,Government agencies,"MANILA -- The Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) will issue new motor vehicle (MV) and motorcycle (MC) license plates in late April as a measure not only to promote road safety, but also to help ease traffic congestion. The security features of the new plates will help weed out colorum vehicles from the roads, which will better assure the safety of the riding public. They will also help in reducing the anticipated traffic in Metro Manila. Of course, these features will also enable authorities to enforce criminal and traffic laws more effectively, said DOTC Secretary Jun Abaya. The DOTC has given the signal to proceed to PPI-JKG Philippines, Inc., which won the public bidding last year for the 5-year contract to supply 5,236,439 pairs of MV plates, and 9,968,017 pairs of MC plates, to the Land Transportation Office (LTO). With these new standardized plates, the 9 different plate designs currently in use since 1981 will be eventually phased-out. Furthermore, private MV plates will sport a new black-and-white design, similar to those in use in most countries around the world. ""For hire' or PUV plates will retain the black-and-yellow scheme. The LTO will start releasing the new license plates beginning in April this year, as PPI-JKG will need one-and-a-half months to manufacture the first set of plates, which will then be distributed to LTO district offices nationwide. The new plates will have tamper-resistant locks and screws which will permanently attach the plates to the vehicle, preventing the transfer of the plate from one vehicle to another, which is commonly done in perpetrating crimes such as carnapping and in operating ""colorum"" PUVs. A ""third plate"" windshield sticker will replace the current sticker which is renewed during annual registration, and will indicate the vehicle's license plate number. For PUVs, the 'third plate' will also indicate the vehicle's authorized route, preventing out-of-line ""colorum"" operations and plate tampering. With these new security features, it will be easier for the LTO, Land Transportation and Franchising Board (LTFRB), and other law enforcement agencies to weed out ""colorum"" vehicles roads, easing traffic congestion. An estimated one thousand units of ""colorum"" buses are believed to be plying EDSA on a daily basis. Among the other anti-colorum efforts of the DOTC, LTFRB, and LTO are the possible imposition of stiffer penalties for colorum operators, including a P 1-Million fine, as well as the use of technology to zero-in on violators. Last year, the LTFRB also launched its Oplan Goliath campaign to apprehend unauthorized PUV services on the road.",,ABS-CBNnews.com,"LTO, LTFRB, DOTC",yes,2014-02-22 00:00:00,issuance of new license plates,,,,,,,,english,,http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/02/22/14/new-lto-plates-promote-road-safety-weed-out-colorum,,"metro manila, manila",text,,102.0,,2417.0,,mavie,,,license plates,7.0,Straight News,,,,,"improvement of traffic enforcement, stricter public transport franchise regulation, improved license plates",abs-cbnnews,no,no,,,,"New LTO plates to promote road safety, weed out colorum",Neutral,,

2014-02-22,,,Malacanang,"Its been quite a rocky road for motorists and commuters since the construction of the Skyway Stage 3 project started on Monday. On Day 1 of the construction of the 14.8-kilometer, six-lane Skyway 3, which is expected to reduce travel time from Buendia to Balintawak from two hours to 20 minutes or less, students and workers were infuriated when traffic came to a standstill at the height of rush hourand at off-peak hours. But no one was really stuck in traffic as the government got the show on the road, or so said Malacaang. The Palace told a different story as it credited the traffic rerouting scheme and surprisingly compliant motorists for the relatively moderate traffic flow in the capital since the start of the construction project. The monstrous traffic jams that have been predicted during the simultaneous construction of major road projects in Metro Manila have yet to materialize, three Cabinet members told President Benigno Aquino III in a meeting Friday at the Palace. The worst is yet to come, the public is told, as construction of the other major project, the NLEx-SLEx (North and South Luzon Expressways) Connector Road, which follows the same alignment as Skyway Stage 3, gets underway in July this year. Motorists and commuters are thus advised to brace themselves for an even more hellish traffic gridlock. This means that there is ample time to make further adjustments, Communications Secretary Herminio Coloma said. Traffic snarls have been expected to be triggered by these two major road projects beginning simultaneouslythe Skyway project to connect South Luzon Expressway on Gil Puyat Avenue in Makati City to North Luzon Expressway in Balintawak, Quezon City, and the construction of Naia Expressway Phase 2, which will connect the airport to the Entertainment City gambling hub. Coloma told reporters that in a meeting yesterday, Mr. Aquino directed the secretaries of the departments of public works, transportation and local government as well as the chair of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) to fine-tune mitigation and remedial measures designed to minimize the citizens (traffic) inconvenience. The President asked the four Cabinet members to coordinate with the Department of Education, Commission on Higher Education, Department of Labor and Employment and Department of Trade and Industry. MMDA Chair Francis Tolentino, delighted with what the government considers better-than-expected traffic flow in and around the cities of Makati and Manila, reported to the President that traffic volume along South Superhighway had been reduced by more than seven percentor from 131,000 to 122,000 vehiclesdaily since the start of construction on Monday evening. This shows that affected motorists have begun using alternate routes, adjacent to the construction area, Tolentino was quoted by Coloma as telling the President. What he apparently failed to explain to the President was that many motorists coming from the south were using C-5 Highway to avoid the expected gridlock on Osmea Highway, which straddles both Makati and Manila and Edsa. Many Metro Manilans were also avoiding Makati and Manila on purpose after the government announced the start of the Skyway 3 construction. Tolentinos report is a welcome respite to the Palace, which has been flooded with appeals from motorists and commuters to address the looming monstrous traffic jams. Overpopulation, lack of discipline, corruption and excessive number of motor vehicles plying Metro Manilas roads have been blamed for the traffic congestion. Malacaangs response is to appeal for a united sacrifice during the construction period. We renew our call that we share in the burden of sacrifice, and bear with the short-term inconvenience, so we can reap the benefits of faster travel and higher productivity, Coloma said. Public Works Secretary Rogelio Singson, for his part, told the President that Edsa, which carries the heaviest volume of motor vehicles, would not undergo any major construction or repair. Those using this major artery will not be affected significantly, Singson said. DPWH Secretary Rogelio Singson said efforts will be exerted to ensure that road projects in other areas will be implemented in a manner that will minimize disruption and inconvenience to citizens, said Coloma. These projects will bring about an improved quality of life due to ease of travel across Metro Manila that will benefit the citizens, communities, businesses and industries in Calabarzon (Region IV-A), National Capital Region and Central Luzon, an area that presently contributes about 60 percent of the countrys gross domestic product, he said. Coloma said the government was also studying the road worthiness and safety of all public utility vehicles such as jeepneys and buses as part of efforts to decongest roads in the capital.

2014-02-22,,,Government agencies,"MANILA  Authorities conducted a bus inspection on Viron Transit on Saturday morning in Cubao, Quezon City. The inspection on the terminal and bus units of Viron was conducted by officials of the Land Transportation, Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), the Land Transportation Office (LTO), and Department of Transportation and Communication (DOTC). LTFRB's Atty. Mary Salada said they consider Viron Transit as ""the best"" among all the companies they have recently inspected. The company didn't have any major violations, but only had minor violations such as lack of ""no smoking"", ""persons with disabilities"", and ""LTFRB hotline"" signages. ""So far po, medyo minor observation ang nakita natin sa capacity marking, na kailangan po mailagay ng medyo malaki doon sa tagiliran, [sa] both sides ng bus, para po in case of emergency na makikita yung bus sa aksidente ay madali po ma-identify,"" said Mohammad Yusoph Lamping, director of Law Enforcement Service of LTO. The team also noted that the registration plates match with the chassis number of each unit, contrary to what they have observed in other bus companies. The chief legal counsel of Viron Transit said they phased-out most of their old units, leaving them with only 34 from the original 114. Meanwhile, Lampin assured the public that they are doing their jobs, after the agency received flak for several bus accidents that happened recently. ""Ang direktiba ng ating DOTC Secretary Honorable Joseph Emilio Aguinaldo Abaya sa LTFRB Chairman Ginez at assistant secretary Alfonso Tan Jr. [ay magkaroon ng] close coordination ang LTO at LTFRB and then binigyan po sila ng mandato ng LTO Law Enforcement na sisikapin po natin itong pag-iinspeksyon sa ating mga bus.""

2014-02-22,,,,"MANILA -- The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) will invite officials of the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) to attend upcoming hearings with transport groups on increasing the minimum fare in passenger jeepneys. Another hearing with transport groups will be held on March 7, a day before the proposed fare increase. Transport groups ACTO (Alliance of Concerned Transport Organizations) and ALTODAP (Alliance of Transport Operators and Drivers Association of the Philippines) will implement a provisional P0.50 centavo jeepney fare increase on March 8, with or without government approval. LTFRB Chairman Winston Ginez warned that they will sanction those who will adjust fares without approval. Ginez said the issue on traffic due to road projects and the impact of the 4-day school week have yet to be seen. He also assured transport groups that the rerouting map currently being designed by the government will not affect routes of public utility vehicles since it will focus on the rerouting of private cars. The LTFRB still needs to conduct at least 3 more hearings before they can issue a final decision on the jeepney fare hike petition. Aside from MMDA, LTFRB is also expecting representatives from the Department of Trade and Industry to attend the hearing to provide information on how price increase can affect those in the transportation sector. --",report from DZMM,ABS-CBNnews.com,,yes,2014-02-22 00:00:00,jeepney minimum fare,,,,,,,,english,,http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/02/22/14/mmda-dti-invited-fare-hike-hearing,,"metro manila, manila",text,,799.0,,56.0,,pia,,,jeepney fare,4.5,Straight News,,,,,,abs-cbnnews,no,,,,,"MMDA, DTI invited to fare hike hearing",,,
2014-01-04,,dead:1,,"DAGUPAN CITY  A bus driver was shot deadSaturdayafternoon in what could be a road rage incident at the national highway near the boundary of Rosales, Pangasinan and San Manuel, Tarlac. Police identified the victim as Joseph Villacorta, driver of a Metro Manila-bound Solid North Bus and resident of Urdaneta City. He was shot by Frederick dela Cruz, 35, a businessman, who resides in Quezon City. In a text message to the Philippine Daily Inquirer, Senior Inspector Ryan Manongdo, Pangasinan police spokesperson, said the passenger bus and Dela Cruzs pick-up truck were both traveling in the slow-moving southbound lane of the national highway at about3:30 p.m. Saturday, when for a still unclear reason, Villacorta and Dela Cruz engaged in a shouting match. Dela Cruz shot Villacorta, hitting him in the chest. Responding policemen took Villacorta to the Dr. Chan Memorial Hospital in Barangay Carmen in Rosales where doctors there pronounced him dead on arrival. Dela Cruz escaped by boarding a passenger bus, according to his wife, Catherine dela Cruz, 33, who was driving the pick-up truck when policemen intercepted it in San Manuel, Tarlac. Heavy traffic had been noted in Barangay Carmen because of the repair of a road section there and the Christmas sale at SM City Rosales, which is along the national highway, and the thousands of motorists heading back to Metro Manila after the holidays.

2014-03-01,,hurt:11,,"MANILA, PhilippinesAt least 11 were injured when a passenger bus lost its brakes and plowed through seven vehicles along Commonwealth Avenue in Quezon City Saturday noon. Mayamy Transport bus rammed into the center island of the major thoroughfare, also known as the killer highway, damaging its grills and blocking the opposite lane going to Batasan Road. Police Officer 2 Allan Florendo, of the Quezon City Police Traffic Sector 5, told INQUIRER.net over the phone that the bus going to Regalado lost control and crashed into the vehicles. Florendo said the Mayamy Transport bus, bearing the plate number TXW 386, came from the Elliptical Road. The bus driver and conductor fled from the scene, according to the passengers of a UV Express, one of the seven vehicles in the accident. The rider of a motorcycle involved in the multiple collision was said to be in critical condition. Most victims were rushed to East Avenue Medical Center in Quezon City but Florendo said, some sought treatment in other nearby hospitals. He added that authorities have brought the bus to the impounding area. Commonwealth Avenue has been the scene of many accidents, including one that claimed the life of journalist Lourdes Chit Estella in May 2011. In 2010, Metro Manila Development Authority showed that at least 21 lives were claimed in the highway while 608 others were injured in more than 2,000 accidents that took place along Commonwealth Avenue. The following year, the MMDA implemented a 60kilometer per hour speed limit on Commonwealth Avenue to reduce the possibility of accidents in addition to setting aside two lanes for passenger buses. It also deployed several traffic enforcers to the area equipped with radar speed guns.

2014-01-05,,dead:1,Vehicle users,"DAGUPAN CITYWhen bus driver Joseph Villacorta left the Solid North Transit terminal in this city in Pangasinan province for Cubao, Quezon City, about 2 p.m. on Saturday, little did his colleagues know that it was going to be his last trip. More than an hour later, Villacorta, 42, was felled by a bullet near the boundary of Pangasinan and Tarlac provinces in Barangay (village) Carmen in Rosales town. The suspect: A pick-up truck driver, who had tried to overtake Villacortas bus in the slow-moving southbound lane of the MacArthur Highway in the area. The suspect was later identified as Frederick dela Cruz, 35, a businessman from Quezon City. There was no quarrel, said Wilfredo Villa, operations manager of the Solid North Transit here. The bus driver and his conductor just wanted to talk to the pick-up driver about the bus broken side mirror. The truck driver was hot-headed, Villa said. SPO1 Oliver Vingua, who investigated the incident, said the bus and the truck were among the hundreds of vehicles crawling on a single lane as they entered San Manuel town in Tarlac at 3:30 p.m. Saturday. From two lanes, he said, they were to merge in that area to avoid hitting the base of an old welcome arch built across the road. But as the bus swerved to the one-lane road, the truck allegedly overtook the bus, its right side mirror hitting the bus. Police said Dela Cruz got off his truck, threw a rock that hit the bus left side mirror and got back to his truck. Villa said Villacorta and his conductor, Melvin Intal, got off the bus and tried to talk to Dela Cruz. But they were ignored. The pick-up truck driver just drove off, Villa said. But because of the heavy traffic, Dela Cruzs truck did not get far. It was here, Villa said, when Intal ran to the front of Dela Cruzs truck to ask him to talk about the bus side mirror that he broke. But instead of getting off, the driver tried to hit Intal with his pick-up truck. He ran over the conductors foot, breaking his toes, Villa said. He said that when Intal fell, Villacorta got off the bus to help him. At this point, the pick-up truck driver got off with a clutch bag, pulled out his gun and shot Villacorta, hitting him in the chest, Villa said. Villacorta died while policemen were taking him to the Dr. Chan Memorial Hospital in Barangay (village) Carmen in Rosales. Dela Cruz drove off with his truck, which police later intercepted in San Manuel, Tarlac. Dela Cruz, however, was no longer driving the pick-up truck when it was stopped. It was Dela Cruzs wife, Catherine, 33, who was then driving and she told policemen that her husband had boarded a passenger bus. Aside from his wife, Dela Cruzs passengers were his three children aged 14, 9 and 7, police said. Villa said Villacorta, a resident of Urdaneta City, was a jolly and a hardworking person. He laughed and always smiled. He worked hard for his five children that included two sets of twins, Villa said. This is the first time that it happened to our bus company since we started operations in Pangasinan three years ago, he said. Villa said Solid Norths bus drivers are properly trained and they undergo periodic seminars on road courtesy and defensive driving. Vingua said the shooting could have been avoided if drivers exercised basic road courtesy. They should be patient and cool-headed, Vingua said. Traffic had been heavy in several parts of the MacArthur Highway because of repairs on sections from Moncada, Tarlac, to Sison, Pangasinan, and the thousands of motorists returning to Metro Manila after the holidays.",,"9:33 PM | Sunday, January 5th, 2014",Solid North Transit Terminal Management,yes,2014-01-05 00:00:00,road rage,,,,,,,,english,,http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/558227/bus-driver-shot-dead-in-road-rage,,"quezon, dagupan, metro manila, tarlac, manila, urdaneta, pangasinan",text,,311.0,,1406.0,,mavie,,,road rage,6.0,Straight News,,,,,respect and road courtesy,inquirer,no,no,,,,Bus driver shot dead in road rage  | Inquirer News,Neutral,,

2014-01-08,,,,"ROSALES, PangasinanThe pickup truck driver, who allegedly shot and killed a bus driver and wounded its conductor in a case of road rage here, has been charged with murder and attempted murder in the provincial prosecutors office. SPO1 Oliver Vingua, Rosales police investigator, said the slain bus drivers wife, Rowena Villacorta, and the bus conductor, Melvin Intal, filed the complaints on Monday against Frederick de la Cruz, 35, who fled and left behind his family after shooting and killing Joseph Villacorta on Saturday. The shooting was triggered by a heated exchange that ensued when the right side mirror of De la Cruzs pickup truck hit Joseph Villacortas bus as they merged on a single lane of the MacArthur Highway near the Pangasinan-Tarlac boundary in Barangay (village) Carmen here. After realizing that his side mirror was damaged, De la Cruz picked up a rock and threw it at the bus left side mirror to get even, police said. Intal, worried that he and Villacorta would be made to answer for the broken side mirror, tried to confront De la Cruz by standing in front of the pickup truck, which was stalled by heavy traffic. But instead of alighting from his vehicle, De la Cruz allegedly stepped on the gas pedal to slam his pickup truck into Intal. De la Cruz ran over Intals foot, causing him to fall on the road. Seeing this, Villacorta got off the bus to help Intal. But De la Cruz also got off his truck and shot Villacorta, hitting him in the chest. In a TV interview on Monday, De la Cruz invoked self-defense. He said Villacorta was holding a rock and was about to smash him with it so he was forced to shoot him. De la Cruz then drove off after the shooting but his pickup truck was intercepted at a checkpoint in San Manuel town in Tarlac. Police, however, found De la Cruzs wife, Catherine, driving the vehicle. She told policemen that her husband had boarded a bus.

2014-02-24,,,,"MANILA, Philippines - Priests, too, are on call. And with this nature of their job, an official of the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) pushed to exempt priests from the number coding scheme. Fr. Edu Gariguez, executive secretary of the CBCP National Secretariat for Social Action, said they should be granted exemption from the scheme because priests need mobility  especially with the anticipated heavy traffic in the major roads in Metro Manila due to the Skyway 3 extension project. We need total mobility thats why if possible we want to be exempted from coding because the work of a priest doesnt have a fixed time, he said. Gariguez lamented their duties to administer last rites for dying persons are usually jeopardized by immobility caused by the traffic-coding scheme. For example, there is a sick call, somebody died or somebody is in a life and death situation... we priests need to be there right away to cater to their pastoral needs, he said. The Skyway 3 will connect the North Luzon (NLEX) and South Luzon Expressways (SLEX) with an elevated expressway over Osmea Highway, linking it with Quirino Avenue in Manila. If theres traffic, our ability to give pastoral ministry will suffer, Gariguez said. He said the Mass for weddings or even for funerals may also be delayed if the officiating priest is caught in traffic.

2014-02-25,,,,"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) warned transportation groups Monday against implementing any fare increase without prior approval as this would lead to sanctions. The board issued the statement after public jeepney operators sought to hike the minimum fare from P8 to P10. The petition also included a plea for a 50-centavo provisional increase. According to LTFRB Chair Winston Ginez, they will be forced to impose sanctions on transport groups that defy the boards order not to increase minimum fares. He added that a fourth hearing on the matter would be held on March 7 where the board would decide on a concrete and impartial resolution. Transport groups cannot simply adjust fares whenever they want; there must be a proper forum to discuss their appeal, Ginez said. He stressed that the groups must back up their petition with solid evidence that the increase was necessary.

2014-02-26,,,,"Last Monday, the first day of the expanded truck ban in Manila and the strike by protesting truckers, Manila Mayor Joseph Erap Estrada came ready: He was dressed in a camouflage uniform. On the first day of the bus ban, he also came in combat fatigues. Asked by journalists at the Kapihan sa Manila at the Diamond Hotel why he was in combat uniform, Erap answered, I have been challenged by the truckers. Asked whether he was packing a gun, he replied In the car. Mayor Estrada was accompanied at the forum by Vice Mayor Isko Moreno and Councilors Manuel Zarcal and Jocelyn Quintos who were the authors of the city ordinance expanding the truck ban. The city officials defended the truck ban, saying that Manila (in fact, the whole of Metro Manila) has been suffering from traffic congestion for decades and it was time something was done. Previous city officials did nothing, Erap said, now we are finally doing something. How would he deal with the striking truckers? Sa umpisa lang yan, (Thats only in the beginning), he replied. People in general do not want to adjust, but once they see the benefits of the change, they follow. Erap pointed to the bus ban. At first, the bus drivers and operators also protested. Now the bus ban is going on smoothly. The drivers and operators are happy. Traffic flows faster and smoother, they save on fuel and the wear and tear on the buses and they earn faster. When the expanded truck ban also gets going, the truckers will also be happy, the mayor said. At night, and during the windows in the day when the ban would be lifted, one lane of Roxas Boulevard would be reserved for the trucks. They can deliver their loads faster without disturbing traffic so much. The truck ban was expanded to provide relief to the thousands of office workers and students who have to leave for their offices and schools at 5 a.m. in order to arrive there at 8 a.m., Erap said. At that time, the trucks are still out in the streets, contributing to the traffic congestion. We are removing the trucks only during the time that students and workers are on the way to their schools or work. When they are already in school and at work later in the day, there is a window for the trucks. During going-home time, the trucks would be banned again. For the whole night when traffic is light, the truckers can do their deliveries again. Is that not a good arrangement? But the warehouses are closed at night, the truckers wail. They, too, will have to adjust, Erap said. On the claim that the economy would suffer because of late deliveries, Vice Mayor Isko countered that the economy loses P4.1 billion a day because of the traffic jams, according to a study by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (Jica). Multiply that by 365 days and the losses to the economy amount to trillions of pesos. The losses due to late deliveries are peanuts compared to that. The new schedule gives the truckers an additional five hours to operate for six months. The truckers are now allowed 15 hours to ply Manilas streets instead of the original planned eight hours. During these six months, the Philippine Ports Authority will transfer much of the operations of the South Harbor and North Harbor to the Batangas and Subic ports which are underutilized. Cargo bound for south Luzon will be unloaded in Batangas while those bound for north Luzon will be unloaded in Subic. And that would be in the nick of time. Erap revealed that the Department of Public Works and Highways found cracks in the Del Pan and Sta. Cruz bridges due, no doubt, to the continued stress from passing heavy trucks. Asked about the claim of the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) that container vans would accumulate in the South Harbor if the truckers declared a strike, Erap replied, Thats their problem. Why should the people of Manila suffer for their shortcomings? Why do we have to solve their problems? the mayor added. Erap and Isko said that the trucks not only contribute to traffic jams but have made Bonifacio Drive, from the Anda Circle to the North Harbor, their private parking lot. The street is always full of trucks double- and triple-parked. Yet there is plenty of space inside the Port Area. Why dont they use that? Erap asked. Why are they using our city roads for their parking. Isko said the PPA is very strict in allowing vehicles to enter its compound. He revealed that he and Mayor Estrada were prevented from entering when they came for a look-see. The mayor and vice mayor of Manila are prevented from entering a place within their jurisdiction? the reporters asked incredulously. Yes, we were. Somebody asked why they did not call the police like Mayor Junjun Binay of Makati did when he was prevented from exiting Dasmarias Village through a closed gate. We are not like that, they said. Vice Mayor Isko said kotong (extortion) by Manila policemen has been reduced drastically. Proof: City collections from traffic fines has risen from less than P8 million to P11 million a day. The lines of drivers paying their fines at City Hall last the whole day. That can only mean that the policemen are arresting more erring drivers and accepting less bribes, Isko said. They are afraid of the One Strike Policy of President-Mayor Estrada. One strike and youre out. Erap was asked to explain his tampuhan with Vice President Jejomar Binay, his political ally, over the Central Market. Erap explained that SM has offered to rebuild Central Market for free. Manila has a usufruct on the land which belongs to an agency of the national government of which Binay is the vice chair. Here is our chance, Erap said. Manila is bankrupt. It cannot afford to rehabilitate the Central Market on its own. SM is heaven-sent. Why not accept its offer?",Neal H.

2014-07-27,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesA police official urged a road rage suspect, caught on video pointing a gun at a taxi driver on Edsa-Santolan last Friday, to come forward to air his side. This, after taxi driver Glen Remetio, 43, a resident of Barangay (village) Manggahan, Pasig city, filed complaints of grave threats, physical injuries, and malicious mischief against the yet unidentified Mercedes Benz driver. The incident, a harrowing video of which has been spreading online, happened July 25 around 3:30 p.m. at the Edsa-Santolan flyover in Barangay Bagong Lipunan ng Crame in Quezon City, a police report reaching the Quezon City Police District (QCPD) headquarters in Camp Karingal showed. The video, apparently taken by a passenger on a bus, starts with the SUV already parked in front of Remetios cab (UVN 607), and the SUV driver, in a blue shirt and denim pants, accompanied by an elderly man in white, standing outside Remetios shattered drivers window and arguing with the cabbie inside. The two-minute-and-35-second video has been circulating on social networking site Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=4235466060805) and video-sharing site YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex1k8gOYlvk) over the weekend. Remetio could be seen swiping a screwdriver at the SUV driver from inside the cab. As Remetio tried to step out, the SUV driver violently kicked at the car door to keep it closed. When Remetio, still armed with the screwdriver, got out to face the other man, the SUV driver pulled out a handgun from a bag and pointed it at the taxi driver. The shrieks of the video-takers co-passengers could be heard in the background. The argument continued with the SUV driver pushing at Remetio, and Remetio occasionally stepping forward, deflecting the other mans hands and pointing angrily. At one point, the SUV driver put his gun back in his car, but went on to grab what looked like a glass shard from inside Remetios car. The argument seemed to end with Remetio stepping away, and the SUV driver and his passenger getting back into the Mercedes Benz. The video-taker could be heard reciting the plate numbers of the involved vehicles. When the SUV drove off, Remetio could be seen chasing after it. In the video, the cars and drivers were later on spotted parked on the inner lane further along Edsa, this time with the taxi in front of the Mercedes Benz. According to the Cubao-based Quezon City Police District (QCPD) Station 7, which has jurisdiction over the area, the SUV and the taxi had been going the same way on the southbound lane starting in Cubao. But Remetio had unintentionally been driving too close to the other car, leading to the impression that he was elbowing the SUV. Nagsimula sa Cubao-Ilalim. Pag-ahon, nagkagitgitan. Sa [Edsa-Santolan] flyover, nagitgit niya uli. Kaya akala siguro ng SUV, sinasadya na, (It started at the Cubao underpass. The cars grazed each other coming out. At the flyover, Remetio unintentionally grazed the SUV again. So the SUV driver probably thought it was intentional), the QCPD Station 7 commander, Supt. Ramon Pranada said, quoting Remetio. According to the police report, Remetio was driving a passenger to Ortigas, when the SUV driver suddenly cut in front of his cab at the flyover. Aside from pointing a gun at Remetio, the SUV driver had punched and injured the cabbie, punched through Remetios glass window, and caused a dent on the drivers car door when he kicked it, leading to the multiple complaints filed by Remetio, Pranada said. Remetio has only held the SUV driver, not his elderly companion, liable in the incident, Pranada said. The Cubao police have already filed a memo for verification of the SUVs plate number, as read out in the video, with the Land Transportation Office, but would receive the results by Monday, Pranada said. The police commander declined to state the SUVs plate number on record pending the verification. So far, Remetio will not be held liable for arming himself with the screwdriver, unless the other party also files a complaint, according to Pranada. Thats why we are also urging the other party to surface, to clarify this incident and to give their side, Pranada said, in Filipino. RELATED STORIES",Jaymee T.

2014-07-28,,,,"MANILA - A traffic altercation almost turned bloody after two motorists locked horns at the EDSA Santolan flyover recently. The encounter was caught on video by an anonymous witness who was a passenger on a trailing bus. The footage shows the driver of a Mercedes SUV kicking the door of a taxi. The taxi driver emerges wielding a knife. But the SUV driver immediately points a gun at him, forcing him to throw the weapon back into his taxi. The SUV driver eventually takes the knife, leaves his firearm in his SUV, and confronts the taxi driver again, bearing what appears to be the same bladed weapon. After a while, the SUV speeds off, but the taxi chases it along the highway. According to the taxi driver, Glen Remetio, the SUV driver still got away after threatening him again with a gun. Remetio said before the footage was taken, the SUV driver cut him off and broke his window. ""Pag-cut sa akin, bumaba siya, pinagmumura niya ako tapos sabay suntok sa akin,"" he said. Remetio insists the knife he wielded was not his, but was simply in the toolbox of the cab which he shares with other drivers. He defended his decision to chase the SUV, saying he wanted to draw the attention of traffic enforcers. ""Para maimbestigahan kami bakit siya nanutok ng baril, di naman kami nagkabanggaan, di nagkasagian,"" he said.

2014-02-26,,,,"MANILA - The Metro Manila Development Authority is eyeing a compromise in the City of Manila's decision to expand a daytime truck ban. Speaking to radio DZMM, MMDA Chairman Francis Tolentino said Metro Manila mayors have agreed to ask Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada not to make major apprehensions of trucks on Manila roads from 3pm-5pm for the next two weeks. ""Tutupad muna yung 10 am-3pm but give additional 2 hours that there would be no major apprehensions from 3-4 pm or 3-5 pm in Manila except for those that are illegally parked or stalled trucks or naka-obstruct dun sa Del Pan Bridge, which is barred by [Public Works] Secretary [Babes] Singson. This is actually based on the request of truckers,"" he said. Tolentino said the Metro Manila mayors have asked Quezon City Mayor Herbert Bautista to bring the proposal to Estrada. The problem, however, is that none of the major trucker associations are amenable to the proposal and refused to sign off. Tolentino said truckers insist on the removal of the Manila truck ban and assign a dedicated truck lane inside the city. He said the request is impossible since there is not enough road space in Manila to give trucks a dedicated lane. ""Ang point of contention is to remove the truck ban and give a dedicated truck lane. Umaapela tayo sa kanila. Humihingi ako ng paumanhin ngayon napataas na rin ang boses ko. Sabi ko: 'Parang hindi naman kayo Pilipino. Magtulungan naman tayo na mailabas itong nasa loob,'"" he recalled. ""Wala na tayong espasyo na ibibigay. Alam naman natin yun e,"" he added. He also nixed a proposal to allow truckers to use Sucat Road since it will soon be affected by the construction of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) elevated expressway. ""Maraming warehouses sa Sucat pero pag ginawa ang NAIA elevated expressway sarado na rin ang Sucat,"" he said. Manila has expanded the truck ban hours, allowing truckers to use its roads only from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. The city government later introduced a window period from 10 am to 3 pm. Truckers at the Port of Manila and the Manila International Container Port have gone on strike since Monday to protest the truck ban. A TV Patrol report said the strike has led to more than P100 million in losses in revenue collections. [ TV Patrol - http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/video/nation/metro-manila/02/25/14/port-manila-micp-lose-p100m-amid-truck-ban] In a separate interview, Mayor Estrada said he is standing firm on the implementation of the revised truck ban that has led to improved traffic in the city. He said that while he has yet to get the letter from Bautista, he had already agreed that police will not apprehend trucks coming from Manila ports that still have cargo. ""Lahat na may laman na container vans na lumabas sa Customs exempted. Walang huli. Ang huhulihin lamang ay mga container vans na walang cargo, walang laman,"" he told radio DZMM. The ban already exempts trucks carrying perishables and petroleum products, as well as vehicles used for government projects. Estrada said trucks that clog roads from Manila ports all the way to the Del Pan Bridge constitute a traffic hazard. ""Hindi naman nagbabayad ng parking yan at nanggaling na rin kay Secretary Singson na ang Del Pan Bridge na hanggang dun ang pila ng truck, sinabi na ni Secretary Singson na may depekto na ang structure ng Del Pan. Baka bumagsak ang Del Pan bridge e kami pa ang masisi,"" he said. Estrada said the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) should allow truckers to park within its massive facility in the port area instead of along Manila roads. ""Inspeksyunin natin yung loob ng Philippine Ports Authority. Merong 8-10 hektarya dun na bakante, walang nakaparada. Bakit hindi nila papasukin itong mga truck?"" he asked.

2014-02-28,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesA proposed ordinance that will give broader powers to barangay (village) tanod (watchmen) tasked as traffic enforcers in their respective areas, including the authority to confiscate drivers licenses and issue ordinance violation receipts (OVRs), is under review by the Quezon City council. The draft measure has been referred for further study to the councils committees on barangay affairs; public order and security and illegal drugs; and laws, rules and internal government. It has just been passed on first reading. Councilors Jose Visaya and Rogelio Juan, authors of the Barangay Traffic Enforcement Ordinance, proposed that officials of each of the citys 142 barangays be required to designate at least two of their barangay public safety officers (BPSOs) as traffic enforcers. Before their deployment, however, the chosen BPSOs will be required to undergo seminars and a training program under the city governments Department of Public Order and Safety. They will then be deputized as enforcers and authorized to issue OVRs for the implementation of traffic rules and regulations within their respective barangays. The two councilors said the move was necessary as Quezon City was becoming the countrys fastest-growing locality in terms of economy and population. This has led to atrocious traffic congestion and, if not addressed properly, may cause a disruption in the financial expansion of the community, they added. The councilors, however, warned that the barangay chair and council members would be held accountable for any abuses or illegal activities committed by their deputized BPSO traffic enforcers.",Jeannette I.

2014-02-28,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesOrganizers lifted a truck holiday late Wednesday following a deal with Mayor Joseph Estrada and agreed to comply temporarily with Manilas daytime truck ban clamped to ease worsening traffic jams in the Philippine capital. Estrada said trucks loaded with cargoes would now be allowed on Manila roads from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., a two-hour extension from the previous window of 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Empty containers will not be allowed during the window period, the former President and now Manila mayor told the Inquirer in a phone interview. Members of the Integrated North Harbor Truckers Association (INHTA), Alliance of Concerned Truck Owners and Organizations (ACTOO) and Confederation of Truckers Association of the Philippines (CTAP) stopped operations after Manilas unprecedented truck ban was put in effect on Monday. The measure bans eight-wheeler trucks and vehicles with gross weight above 4,500 kilograms from Manilas roads from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. The ordinance provides exemptions to perishable goods and government projects. Enforcement of the ban coincided with the start of two major road projects in Metropolitan Manilaa 14.8-kilometer, six-lane skyway linking South and North Luzon Expressways, and a 6-km stretch connecting Ninoy Aquino International Airport to the seafront Entertainment City. The projects are among 15 planned in the last two minutes of the Aquino administration that are expected to worsen traffic problems. A study by the Japan International Cooperation Agency says that economic losses from the gridlock since 2012 have amounted to P2.4 billion daily and that the figure will soar to P6 billion daily if the problem persists. After a meeting with exporters last week, the Manila city government granted a 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. window during which trucks would be allowed in the capital. That, however, did not appease the truckers associations, who went ahead with their truck holiday, keeping off the road container vans, to the chagrin of port authorities and customs collectors. On Monday, customs authorities said that on the first day of the ban, collections at the Manila International Container Port dropped by 27 percent from a daily average of P360 million and 47 percent from the Port of Manila from a daily average of P250 million. On Wednesday, the third day of the truck holiday, Quezon City Mayor Herbert Bautista went to Estradas office to deliver the resolution of the Metropolitan Manila Council asking the city not to apprehend trucks from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. Estrada said the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) had also agreed to provide a holding area so that the trucks would not line up on roadsides. The mayor told us to give the ordinance a chance, CTAP chair Rodolfo de Ocampo told the Inquirer. Our group has decided to concede and deliver the containers piling up at the port since it is hurting the economy. INHTA president Teddy Gervacio in a radio interview said the truckers would observe Manilas truck ban for three days and then they would meet with Estrada again. ACTOO, on the other hand, maintained that the temporary suspension of their strike was based on the condition that loaded trucks would now be allowed throughout the day. The PPA, Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA), Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board and Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) have also given a commitment to help the truckers against abusive towing and to assist in talks with affected neighboring cities. If these conditions are not met, we will resume the strike, said an ACTOO member. While the truckers are getting sympathetic ears from Bautista et al., motorists began feeling the effects of the expanded window as traffic volume increased. Bautista wasnt even looking at East Avenue, where traffic was jammed for hours near Quezon City Hall all the way to Edsa, with vehicles parked in no parking zones on the major road artery Thursday afternoon. We gave them seven hours upon the representation of MMDA Chair Francis Tolentino and DPWH Secretary Rogelio Singson on condition that they will open up the gates going inside PPA, Estrada told reporters on Thursday. Estrada and Vice Mayor Isko Moreno clarified that the two-hour extension for inbound and outbound trucks loaded with cargo would be in effect on a trial basis for two weeks. Its possible that we will extend or reduce the hours or make it 24/7. But the operative word is possible, Moreno said. He said 13th Street up to the 24th Street in Port Area had been cleared to serve as truck loading area. No queuing or parking outside the pier, otherwise we will have them towed, he said. Manilas window period will be in effect for six months to allow the cargo-moving industry to transfer operations to the underutilized ports of Batangas and Subic, Moreno said. For 21 years, this is the first time that the mayor attended to this problem, he said. In a statement Thursday, the Makati Business Club (MBC) welcomed a move by the Aquino administration to facilitate a dialogue between the Manila city government and national agencies and other stakeholders to hammer out an appropriate balance between easing congestion and allowing the free flow of goods at the soonest possible time. The influential association of the nations top business corporations acknowledged that traffic jams had been costing the economy billions of pesos in lost revenues arising from decreased productivity and warned further delay in solving the problem would result in adverse effects to the countrys economic performance. In the long term, however, we believe that the provision of adequate infrastructure remains as the primary solution to this problem. As such, we also call on the government to facilitate the immediate construction of much-needed mass transportation and road projects. Government should also provide the necessary infrastructure and incentives to increase cargo traffic in and economic activity around the ports of Subic and Batangas to decongest the port of Manila, the group said. MBC maintains its position that promoting national interest must remain paramount in the formulation and implementation of local ordinances. It is our hope that the resolution of this issue will provide the impetus for better coordination between private and public sectors regarding proposed local policies with national implications.

2014-03-01,,,"Government agencies, Transport sector leaders, Transport sector workers","MANILA, Philippines - Truck drivers should discipline their own ranks and strictly follow the daytime truck ban implemented by the Manila city government, Vice Mayor Isko Moreno said yesterday. Moreno led the police in implementing the truck ban early yesterday morning. Manila has a government night and day. We just want to remind the truck drivers and the people in the city that Manila is not sleeping, he said. We are only after discipline. We do not have any objective but to put everything in order in the decaying Manila, Moreno told GMA-7, which showed a video of a policeman drawing his gun to prevent a truck driver from running him over. The resisting truck driver was given a ticket for violating the daytime truck ban and ordered to pay a fine of P5,000. Moreno said the city government is determined to strictly implement the daytime truck ban until all the truck drivers learn to follow the law. Under the daytime truck ban, empty trucks are banned from traveling the citys streets from 5 a.m. to 10 a.m. and from 3 p.m. to 9 p.m. from Mondays to Saturdays. The truck drivers were given a window from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. They can also travel in Manila from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada said loaded trucks are exempted from the daytime truck ban. The vehicles covered by the daytime truck ban include 8-wheeler trucks with gross weight of 4,500 kilograms. The daytime truck ban ordinance also provided new routes for trucks. Estrada said the city government started implementing the daytime truck ban in anticipation of the heavy traffic caused by the construction of a new skyway along Osmea Highway and the road reblocking being done on EDSA. The city government of Manila began implementing a new truck ban as a compromise after intense opposition from traders and the trucking operators association. Truckers staged a truck holiday as a protest by keeping cargoes in the seaports of Manila and crippled cargo transport to and from the city. The strike was lifted after Estrada offered a compromise this week that would permit use of the city roads by trucks over longer daytime hours. Truckers, however, said the compromise daytime empty truck ban, on its second day of experiment yesterday, was already showing the pain in reduced deliveries in a day. Albert Suansing of the Confederation of Truck Association of the Philippines (CTAP) said that making matters worse was the numerous citations of violation of the daytime truck ban and towing of the trucks, and the stiff penalties imposed on violators. The total penalties slapped on violators ran up to P10,000 because aside from the citation ticket issued to erring truck drivers, there was a towing fee charged, Suansing said. There are around 100 trucks towed, Suansing said. Those cited for truck ban violation is around 200 cases already, both empty and loaded. Suansing said the violations of the truck ban arose from attempts of truck drivers to make their deliveries and then come back to their garage within the 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. window. They are caught between the devil and the deep blue sea, he said. Suansing said yesterdays traffic snarls in Manila should not be blamed all on the Manila city government giving truckers a 10 am to 5 pm window for loaded trucks. It (traffic) is not managed properly, he said. On the other hand, the state-run Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) has laid down a list of measures to further reduce vehicular traffic in and out of the Manila ports even during daytime truck ban. PPA general manager Juan Sta. Ana said the measures would substantially reduce the truckers turn-around time, enabling import and export container deliveries to be delivered faster and more efficiently to and from the ports of Manila and private manufacturing warehouses.

2014-07-30,,,"Vehicle users, Government agencies, Civil society"," MANILA -- Anonymity behind the wheel, lack of concern over public or personal safety, weapons on board. Multimedia motoring personality James Deakin said these are just some elements that trigger a primal reaction like road rage. ''The problem with road rage is people snap, all this becomes irrelevant I think because they can't be seen, that they are encased in this metal. It brings out the worst,'' Deakin told ANC's Headstart. Deakin said motorists should always alert traffic enforcers. And rather than having weapons on board, they should arm themselves with auto insurance, security and information. ''When you know that you have a weapon, your mentality changes. I don't carry them in the car because at the end, I don't see the reason for doing it, because I am human too, I get angry. And if i know I have a weapon and I see red, and bang, wow, it changes your life forever,'' he said. Deakin said authorities can pursue tougher penalties to help prevent road rage. But while driving safety laws may help prevent violence on the road, technological gadgets and social media are powerful tools to prevent the worst from happening. Recently, a video of a man pointing his gun at a taxi driver following a road altercation along EDSA went viral on social networking sites. Police are now set to file charges against the suspect in the controversial gun-toting incident. Deakin said short-tempered motorists can learn many lessons from the incident. ''When you look at that video as an example, when these two drivers (recall what happened), was it worth it? Because now people could be facing jail time, public humiliation for what?"" he said. ''If more people carried cameras in their cars and more people knew that cameras were all around then they tend to behave a little bit better. If I have it all on video I am calm.""

2014-03-05,,,Government agencies,"MANILA, Philippines  Senator Aquilino Koko Pimentel III is seeking an inquiry into the safety of the structure and design of Metro Manilas skyway, following a series of vehicular accidents over the last few months. Pimentel said operators of the skyway are supposed to install adequate safety measures and strictly enforce traffic rules and regulations to protect the lives of motorists using the countrys elevated expressway. It is important to find out whether the skyway operator is properly enforcing traffic rules, speed limit and other regulations, he said in a statement on Wednesday. However, given this many number of accidents, there is a need to ask the more difficult question of whether the design and structure of the Skyway itself is safe by international standards in the first place, he said. Pimentel then filed Senate Resolution No. 550, which calls on the Senate to look into the matter to ascertain why numerous vehicular accidents happened, claiming several lives and causing untold damages to properties over the last few months. The investigation, he said, was timely because of a new plan to build the P26.5 billion elevated expressway that would connect the North Luzon Expressway (NLEx) to the South Luzon Expressway (SLEx). The senator said new measures are also needed to improve safety on roads, especially of the elevated road systems given the fact that there is already an existing skyway and plans to construct more are in the pipeline to solve Metro Manilas worsening traffic gridlocks. Pimentel then cited the latest case of a shuttle van for skyway employees that fell off the elevated expressways southbound lane last Sunday, injuring the driver and a passenger of a sports utility vehicle that hit the van. The probe, he said, will also try to ascertain the need for new safety measures to be adopted to prevent a repeat of the incident and ensure that the structural integrity and design of the expressways are safe by international standards. The biggest tragedy happened on Dec. 16, 2013 when a Don Mariano Transit bus fell off the southbound lane of the South Luzon Skyway, killing 18 passengers and hurting several others. Other accidents involved an armored van that crushed four vehicles and killed one after falling off the skyway on Jan. 25, 2007 and a Dimple Star Transport Corp. bus that also fell off the elevated expressway on July 26, 2011, killing three people.

2014-03-05,,,,"Metro Manila Development Authority's test run on Wednesday morning of the prototype ferry boat to be used for the revival of the Pasig River Ferry Service went on smoothly, a television report said. A report on ""Unang Hirit"" said the dry run began at the old Guadalupe Station in Makati City to Escolta in Manila. MMDA chairman Francis Tolentino said the agency is taking the first step operating the river transport system, even as negotiations with private operators are being done. ""Ang plano talaga natin dito ang MMDA [muna] ang mag-o-operate habang wala pang private operators,"" Tolentino said. But he said, since the MMDA announced the plan to revive the ferry service, several private operators have shown interest in the project. ""Mula nung sinabi natin 'yan [revival of the river ferry], maraming nag-show ng interest. Maging 'yung naluging operator noon gusto na ring mag-operate. So, ang lalabas dito siguro ang sisimulan natin ang missionary route from Rockwell to Escolta in Manila,"" Tolentino said. Moreover, he said the MMDA will meet with the Department of Transportation and Communications and the Pasig River Rehabilitation Commission to set the operational guidelines. ""Pag-uusapan sa meeting kung magkano ang pamasahe, kailan magre-renovate ng mga station at ilan 'yung mag-take ng initiative,"" he said. Due to the worsening traffic situation in Metro Manila, partly because of the ongoing road projects, including the Skyway 3 extension that would connect the South Superhighway and the North Luzon Expressway, the MMDA has set its eyes on the revival of the ferry service along sections of the Pasig River. Citing some information, the report said the ferry transport has been stopped for years as it became unsustainable because the boats used were too big for relatively few commuters patronizing the river transport mode. Tolentino however, expressed confidence the revival of the river ferry could be sustained as it will be using small boats. As planned, the new ferry buses can accommodate 30 to 40 passengers at a time, Tolentino told GMA News Online in a phone interview last Tuesday. This means the new model is much smaller than the 2007 ferries that can hold up to 150 passengers. The number of ferries that will be deployed and the number of trips they will take daily are still subject to discussion, Tolentino added. During the 2007 revival of the Pasig River Ferry Service 2007, much bigger, air-conditioned boats were used to traverse a . The whole section connects six cities. The ferry service was closed in 2011 due to low ridership, PRRC executive director Ronald Naguit said in an .

2014-03-05,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesFor its latest reincarnation, the Pasig River ferry returns as a hybrid between a boat and bus. The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) is set to test on Wednesday a prototype of the ferry it wishes to offer commuters as an alternative mode of transport amid worsening traffic conditions in the capital. Reviving a service that had been on and off for the past two decades, MMDA Chair Francis Tolentino on Tuesday said he would lead Wednesday mornings trial run starting from the old Guadalupe ferry station in Makati City up to Escolta in Manila. The MMDA said it had developed a prototype out of a tug boat fitted with the seats of a bus and capable of carrying up to 40 people. Tolentino said talks were being held between government agencies and private companies interested in giving the Pasig ferry service another try, after earlier ventures failed to last due to financial losses, with the latest operator shutting down in 2011. The earlier operations were also plagued by passenger complaints about the long waiting time at the terminals and the rivers foul smell, among others. In an interview with reporters, Tolentino said the service could be revived not just by one but four or five companies, so Im seeing more water taxis. He said the MMDA, the Pasig River Rehabilitation Commission, and the Department of Transportation and Communications were the agencies that would approve the franchises and licenses of companies operating the ferries. Citing the rivers potential in reducing vehicle and pedestrian volume in the streets, the MMDA chair said the waterway had the equivalent to 10 road lanes.",Nia P.

2014-07-31,,,," MANILA - The taxi driver in the EDSA Santolan road rage incident that was caught on video said the SUV driver was brandishing a real gun and not a toy gun as claimed by the latter's lawyers. Speaking to ABS-CBN's Umagang Kay Ganda, taxi driver Glen Remetio said he was taken aback when the suspect, identified as a certain Karlvin Ang, pulled out a gun from his bag and pointed it at him during the incident. ""Kitang kita ko pong totoong baril. Kaya ko po tinapon yung kutsilyo ko,"" he said. He added: ""(Kung) ibinaril niya sa akin, sasabihin ba nila na toy gun pa rin yun."" Remetio said the altercation happened when he was trying to make a right at the foot of the EDSA Santolan flyover. Instead of letting him pass, the SUV allegedly driven by Ang sped up and cut him off. ""Nanggaling sa ilalim ng overpass, I was trying to make a right. Hindi niya ako pinagbigyan, biglang tumulin siya. Pinagbigyan ko na nga. Pagdating namin sa taas akala niya sinusundan ko siya at hinahabol. Nung ano, bigla na lang napatingin ako sa kanya. Yun siguro yung minasama. Tinignan ko siya ng masama,"" he said. The taxi driver denied shouting curses at the SUV driver. He said it was Ang who stopped his vehicle, got out and then started kicking the door of the taxi while getting the gun out of his bag. Remetio also said he is sure that it was Karlvin Ang who pointed a gun at him. Lawyers of a certain Bill Emerson Tan claimed that it was their client who was driving the SUV involved in the traffic row. Tan is said to be the son of a shareholder of Primex Corp. The taxi driver said that instead of stonewalling, Primex should have come out immediately and identified the driver of the SUV so the matter could be settled. ""Opo, sir, kasi yan talaga ang natatandaan kong mukha. Chinito po. Kung may isa pa silang ano, bakit di nila linabas yung driver ng SUV para magkausap kami. Willing naman akong makipag-ayos sa kanila,"" he said. Asked if he is willing to settle, he said: ""Nasa kanila po yun. Wala po sa akin dahil may kaso na sa husgado."" Station commander Superintendent Ramon Pranada said police have filed charges of grave threats, malicious mischief and physical injury against Karlvin Ang. He said police will investigate the claim that Ang was only using a toy gun. Remetio said he has learned one lesson after the road rage incident. ""Wag nang maging reckless sa pag da-drive.

2014-03-06,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesTwo more companies, including the developer of the upscale Versailles community in Alabang, have expressed interest in participating in a public-private partnership deal for a P2.5-billion public transportation hub in southern Metro Manila. A bid bulletin published Wednesday by the Department of Transportation and Communications showed that State Properties Corp. and Expedition Construction Corp. have acquired bid documents. They are joining nine other groups, including some of the countrys biggest conglomerates, that earlier secured bid documents. The transportation department said in the bulletin that it would hold the second round of one-on-one discussions with the 11 bidders from March 17 to March 20. The bid submission has been set for May 15. State Properties is the developer of the 75-hectare subdivision in Alabang called Versailles, information on its website showed. The PPP project, formally known as the Integrated Transport System Project-Southwest Terminal, aims to provide a central hub where all modes of transportation will be available under one roof. It will be located at a 2.9-hectare property and will connect passengers coming from Cavite to urban transportation vehicles like the Light Rail Transit Line 1, public buses, jeeps and taxis. The other groups that acquired bid documents were the Ayala Group, Metro Pacific Tollways Corp., D.M. Wenceslao and Associates, San Miguel Corp., Vicente T.

2014-03-07,,,,"  In a 12-page decision the LTFRB issued Friday, the board denied the motions for reconsideration filed by both bus firms to lift the preventive suspension order (PSO) issued against them by LTFRB on November 15, 2013, a day after the incident. The board also denied both firms' motions not to revoke their Certificate of Public Convenience (CPCs) for failing to comply with LTFRB rules and regulations.  While we recognized the financial effect on the part of the employees of the two bus companies, the rule of law must prevail above all; the safety of the riding public is the paramount and primordial consideration of the Board, the LTFRB said in its decision.  With the cancellation of their CPCs, the LTFRB ordered the 21 buses units of Elena Liner and 18 buses of MGP Trans to cease and desist from operating.  The yellow plates of these units will be confiscated by the Board, and will be destructed and destroyed prior to their return to the Land Transportation Office (LTO), the LTFRB said.  The regulator said they came up with the decision after taking into consideration five key legal issues.  First, on the argument of Elena Liner and MGP Trans that the issuance of PSO prior to the start of the hearing of the case is a legal violation, the LTFRB said in its decision, ... the Board, pursuant to Section 16 of The Public Service Law, has the power to issue PSO prior to the hearing and as a precautionary measure to avoid recurrence of the same accident and protect the riding public.  Second, the LTFRB argued that while Elena Liner provided medical and financial assistance to the victims, it was not enough basis to absolve the bus firm from the lapses it committed before and during the incident.  In this regard, it is clear that Elena Liner failed to observe extra diligence during its operation by allowing their bus unit (TXT-191) to operate without checking first its roadworthiness before dispatching it, hence its involvement in the accident due to loss of brake, the decision read.  Third, on the argument of both firms that there must first be a conviction of the driver for recklessness before LTFRB can order them to prove that they exercise due diligence in operation, the LTFRB said it can exercise its power anytime to determine whether a franchise holder is still abiding with the LTFRB rules.  Fourth, the LTFRB pointed out that aside from the drivers, the operators can also be at fault for the poor maintenance of the buses that were under investigation.  The LTFRB said lapses on the part of the operators is a ground for the board not only to conduct hearings and investigations but also to impose penalties such as suspension and cancellation of franchises.  Fifth, the LTFRB said that based on their investigation, they found out that Elena Liner failed to exercise extra ordinary diligence required by law, by allowing its bus unit involved in the incident to be dispatched despite mechanical defect, while MGP Trans operator can be at fault for allowing a phased out unit to be dispatched.  The LTFRB also found MGP Trans violating the board's Standard Classification and Guidelines for Garages as the company's garage in West Fairview lacked sufficient parking lot for its number of authorized bus units. The board also said MGP garage lacked a repair shop and equipment.

2014-03-09,,,"Vehicle users, Government agencies, Transport sector leaders, DPWH, Skyway Operation and Management Corp, Toll Regulatory Board","A former party-list representative from the transport sector revealed that several bus operators since January had been staying away from Skyway because of its low railings and that their fears were once again confirmed when a vehicle fell off the elevated highway last week. Homer Mercado of the party-list group 1-Utak, himself the operator of bus companies HM Transport and Worthy Transport, said at least 25 city and provincial operators had been staging a virtual boycott of the tollway because of safety concerns following the Dec. 16, 2013, accident involving a Don Mariano bus that also fell off and left 21 people dead. In a phone interview, Mercado said operators plying routes to southern Metro Manila and southern Luzon provinces had been taking only the service roads on South Luzon Expressway for the last three months to avoid a repeat of the Don Mariano incident. On March 2, the same kind of accident happened, this time involving a shuttle owned by the very company in charge of the highway, Skyway Operation and Management Corp. The vehicle landed on West Service Road after being rear-ended by a Toyota Fortuner. The driver survived the fall. This ongoing boycott involved around 500 buses, translating to millions of pesos in lost tollway fees, Mercado said. We questioned the integrity of the barrier. We raised the issue with Skyway and decided that on a certain date, we will stop taking the Skyway as an expression of our protest, Mercado told the Inquirer in a phone interview. Mercado recalled that following the Don Mariano accident, concerned bus operators asked if the Skyway management could raise the barriers for added safety for the buses, which are normally three meters high. We met with [Skyway president] Manuel Bonoan, but he explained that the barriers already conformed with international standards, that they could handle a sideways collision, Mercado recalled. Bonoan could not be reached for comment on Saturday. In an earlier interview with the Inquirer, former Land Transportation Office chief and now Toll Regulatory Board consultant Albert Suansing made echoed the companys argument. Suansing noted that the vehicles that fell off the Skyway collided with the barriers perpendicularly and that the barriers were not designed for that kind of collision. Should the [Department of Public Works and Highways] redesign them to conform with bad drivers? That doesnt seem right either, Suansing then said. Suansing said an immediate solution to prevent vehicles from falling off the Skyway would be to address driver behavior. He also suggested more signs on the Skyway as safety reminders to drivers, rumble strips on the road to keep them alert in case they are getting sleepy behind the wheel, and increased mobile patrols. The TRB would also study lowering the speed limit on the elevated highway, he said. But for Mercado, there are no preventive measures. They must address both the infrastructure and the drivers. This is not first time (such accidents) happened. Based on Inquirer reports and as confirmed by Mercado, the Skyway shuttle was already the fifth vehicle to have fallen off the elevated highway. The first four were as follows: A sport utility vehicle that crushed a jeepney in Barangay Magallanes, Makati, in October 2006; An armored car that fell on at least four other vehicles on Osmea Highway in January 2007; A Dimple Star Transport bus that also went off-road in Paraaque City, killing three people in July 2011. And the Don Mariano bus, which left the biggest death toll, in December 2013. Mercado said his group was supportive of a similar call made the group Citizens Infrastructure Integrity Watchdog (Infrawatch) to raise the Skyway barrier to at least 1.5 meters. Infrawatch executive director Ricardo Ramos earlier criticized the DPWH for having no safety standards at all as shown by the recent accidents.

According to the board, the inspection teams have been conducting physical inventory and roadworthiness inspections since December last year in line with its aim of modernizing road transport industry and ensuring that only buses that meet the governments safety road regulations are allowed to run on national roads. Among the bus companies inspected by the teams were Pascual Liner, Safeway Bus Lines Inc., Nova Auto Trans, Superlines Transport Co. Inc., Unicab Trans, Princess Youhan, and RRCG. Pascual Liner had the most number of violations like the illegal transfer of engine, no PWD (person with disability) and smoking signs, and no body markings.

2014-03-10,,,Vehicle users,"Sa Metro Manila, nangunguna ang mga motorsiklo sa bilang ng may pinakamaraming naitalang aksidente noong taong 2013, batay sa datos ng MMDA at Highway Patrol Group.  Pero hindi lang pala sa Metro Manila humaharurot ang mga binansagang bagong ""hari ng kalsada"" dahil pati sa Davao City, umaarangkada na rin sila.  Ipinalabas sa programang Alisto ang sampung pinakadelikadong aksidente kasangkot ang mga motorsiklo sa Davao City, base sa lakas ng impact ng aksidente at bilang ng mga nasugatan at namatay.  Paalala ng mga eksperto, defensive driving ang susi para makaiwas sa mga ganitong aksidente.  Kailangan din daw na parating may suot na helmet ang mga rider ng motorsiklo dahil ito ang poprotekta sa kanilang ulo kung sakaling humantong sa aksidente ang kanilang pagmamaneho.  Kung maaari, magsuot din ng protective gear tulad ng elbow at knee pads bilang proteksyon. Maaari ding ma-minimize ng mga ito ang impact ng mga bahagi ng iyong katawan, paraan para makaiwas sa injuries.  Kung sakaling nasa sitwasyon kung saan hindi na maiiwasan ang disgrasya, naroon pa rin dapat ang presence of mind.  Parating tandaan, mga igan: Walang katumbas na halaga ang pagiging alisto at ligtas sa peligro. Maging maingat sa daan bago pa mahuli ang lahat.  Narito ang Top 10 motorcycle accidents sa Davao City... huli sa CCTV!    Sa kuha ng CCTV, makikita ang pagbagsak ng isang motorsiklo sa isang multicab na liliko sana pakaliwa.    Mabilis ang takbo ng motor. Inakala rin nito na hihinto ang multicab mula sa pagliko nito kaya tuluy-tuloy lang ito sa pag-arangkada.  Malakas man ang impact ng motor sa sasakyan, mabilis namang nakatayo ang driver ng motorsiklo.    Mabagal ang takbo ng kotse. Ngunit ang isang overspeeding na motorsiklo, nag-swerve at bumangga rito!    Kitang kita ang pagtilapon ng rider ng motorsiklo! Mabuti na lamang, mabilis na nakapreno ang sumusunod na sasakyan dito.    Makikita sa CCTV na liliko sana pakaliwa ang isang motorsiklo nang biglang may sumulpot na isa pang motorsiklo sa kanyang harapan.    Nagsalpukan ang dalawa at tumilapon ang mga rider nito.  Pero mabilis din silang nakatayo.    Beating the red light ang motorsiklo base sa kuha sa CCTV, kaya tinuturing na kasalanan ng motorsiklo ang aksidente.    Tuluy-tuloy sa pagharurot ang nasabing sasakyan at hindi iniwasan ang jeep na naka-go ang signal light nang mga panahong iyon.  Nagtamo ng minor injuries ang rider ng motorsiklo pero hindi na siya nagsampa ng kaso matapos makipagkasundo sa driver ng jeep.    Mabilis ang takbo ng motorsiklo. Nakita nito sa kanyang harapan ang SUV na noo'y pumipiit pakaliwa. Bumangga ito sa sasakyan dahil sa bilis ng kanyang takbo.    Sa sobrang lakas ng impact, nawasak din ang motorsiklo.  Kitang kita rin sa camera kung papaano namilipit sa sakit ang rider. Masuwerte naman itong nakaligtas.    Nasa tamang daan ang multicab nang bigla itong i-cut ng motorsiklo.    Nagtamo man ng minor injuries ang driver, mapalad naman ito nakaligtas sa bingit ng kamatayan.    Mapapansin na naka-red signal ang traffic light nang umarangkada pa rin ang tricycle kaya tinamaan nito ang isang papalikong motor.    Pero hindi pa rito nagtatapos ang malagim na aksidente. Maya-maya, isang pang tricycle ang sumulpot at sinagasaan ang motorsiklo ng biktima!  Kitang kita sa CCTV kung papaano nagmamadaling tanggalin ng mga sakay ng tricycle ang motorsiklo na bumangga sa kanilang sinasakyan tsaka mabilis na pumuslit ang mga ito sa pinangyarihan ng aksidente.  Buhay ang rider ng motor pero hindi na nahuli ang nakabangga sa kanya.    Sa kuha ng CCTV, makikita ang mabagal na takbo ng jeep habang patawid ng intersection nang biglang may sumulpot na isang humaharurot na motorsiklo mula sa kanyang direksyon.    Hindi raw nag-menor ang rider ng motor sa isang major street. Sa lakas ng impact, tumilapon palabas ang isang babaeng pasahero na nakaupo sa likuran ng jeep.  Kaagad namang nakatayo ang pasahero, samantalang nanatiling nakahiga sa kalsada ang rider ng motorsiklo. Masuwerte pa ring nabuhay ang rider ng motor.    Sa kuha sa intersection, makikita ang kotse na liliko sana pakaliwa. Makikita na naka-on ang signal light nito. Pero isang humaharurot na motorsiklo ang mabilis na sumalpok dito.    Mabilis ang dating ng motor at malinaw naman ang signal light ng kotse. Ngunit sa bilis ng takbo ng motor, hindi na ito pa nakapreno.  Tumilapon pa sa bubong at likod ng kotse ang rider bago ito bumagsak sa kalsada. Nagtamo man siya ng injuries, nakaligtas naman ang rider ng motor.    Naganap ang naturang aksidente sa J.P. Laurel Avenue. Tatawid na sana ng intersection ang truck ng biglang sumulpot ang isang humaharurot na motorsiklo sa kabilang direksyon.

2014-07-31,,,,"Shortly after the police filed a case against Karlvin Earnest Angidentified by taxi driver Glen Remetio as the Mercedes Benz driver who pointed a gun at him following a traffic altercation last Fridaya lawyer came forward claiming that they sued the wrong man. The 33-year-old Ang, director and corporate secretary of Primex Corp., a real estate development firm located in Greenhills, San Juan City, was charged yesterday with malicious mischief, physical injury and grave threats in the Quezon City Prosecutors Office. This was after he was positively identified by Remetio, who was shown pictures of the firms employees. When we showed him [Angs] picture, he had tears in his eyes and said, Thats him! Thats him, said Senior Insp. Virgilio Carodan, chief of the Quezon City Police Districts Station Investigation and Detective Management Branch. [Remetio] said he would never forget the face of the man who pointed a gun at him. Remetio also confirmed to the Inquirer in a phone interview that Ang was the driver of the sport utility vehicle. He said that since the road rage incident on July 25, he had gone on leave. Who can work in this situation? Im frightened of them because they are rich and powerful, he added. I just want them to face me so I can go back to work in peace. But when reached by the Inquirer, Robert dela Cruz, a manager at Primex, said in a phone interview that it was not Ang who was involved but Bill Emerson Tan, the son of one of the company directors. The name is wrong because we already divulged the name of the real person involved to the police station in Cubao. I believe they will correct that, he added. Dela Cruz said the company should be left out of the matter because the person involved in the traffic row was not an employee of the company. Id like to clarify that even though the vehicle involved is registered under the name of the company, the incident [involved] someone who is totally not connected with us, he pointed out. We issued the car for the use of the director. We didnt know the son was using it, he said, adding that Tan was also planning to file a case against Remetio who, he claimed, threatened him first with a knife. Derrick Delegencia, Tans lawyer, said he was surprised to know that the police had filed the case against Ang. Stressing that his client had been traumatized by the incident, he added that he went yesterday to the Cubao police station, which has jurisdiction over the incident, to talk to Remetio about a settlement. Carodan, meanwhile, stressed that the information in the filed complaint would not be changed, saying they had been waiting for two days for a representative from the company to talk to investigators but no one showed up. PO3 Ronnie Ereo, case investigator, said two notices were served to Primex to no avail. Aside from the charges filed against him, Ang may also be charged with illegal possession of firearms after the Philippine National Police confirmed that it had no record of him holding a license for any type of gun. The altercation between Ang and Remetio happened on July 25 on the southbound lane of the Edsa-Santolan flyover near Camp Crame in Quezon City. As captured on video by a bus rider, it showed Ang and an elderly man standing beside Remetios cab. When Remetio took out a knife and tried to get out of his cab, Ang kicked the door repeatedly to prevent him from alighting. When the cab driver finally emerged from the vehicle, Ang took a gun out of his bag and pointed it at him. Based on Remetios version of the incident, it all started when he switched to the rightmost lane of Edsa after he emerged out of the Cubao underpass, earning him dagger looks from Ang. He said that after the Benz cut across his path, Ang got out, swore and shouted at him repeatedly. He added that he rolled down his window to ask Ang what the matter was but the latter smashed it with his fist. Blood was dripping from his hand, Remetio said, adding that Ang kept on kicking the taxi cabs door, preventing him from getting out. Remetio said that he pulled out a knife to make Ang stop and back away. When he got out of his taxi, Ang pulled out a gun and Remetio said he threw his knife back into his cab. He might claim that I stabbed him, he added. He added that Ang took the knife from his cab, telling him, This is evidence. Remetio, however, said he would be willing to accept a settlement should Ang apologize to him and pay for the damage to his car amounting to P32,442.",,", | 2:28 AM | Thursday, July 31st, 2014",Philippine National Police,yes,2014-07-31 00:00:00,road rage,,,,,"Lawyer claims cops, complaining cabbie got wrong man",,,english,,http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/625110/edsa-road-rage-driver-charged-but,,"quezon, san juan, quezon city",text,,589.0,,2308.0,,candice,another article about the Mercedes Benz driver who pointed a gun at a taxi driver,,road rage,5.0,Straight News,,,,,,inquirer,no,,,,,Edsa road rage driver charged but... | Inquirer News,,,
2014-03-11,,,,"The operator of the 16.4-kilometer Skyway elevated toll road in southern Metro Manila is expecting a hit on toll revenues if more than two dozen bus companies make good on their threat to boycott the expressway due to alleged safety issues, its top official said Monday. Skyway Operations and Maintenance Corp. CEO Manuel Bonoan, however, said the toll road was safe and conformed with international standards. The reported boycott, disclosed in a previous report by former party-list representative Homer Mercado, would involve at least 25 companies, or 500 bus units, including Mercados HM Transport and Worthy Transport. No date for the move was mentioned. The planned boycott was to protest the operators failure to add new infrastructure safety measures in the wake of the Don Mariano incident last December, when a public bus fell off the elevated toll road, killing 21 people. These measures include addressing the integrity and height of the barriers. Bonoan said Skyway, which is mainly owned by San Miguel Corp. and Indonesias Citra Group, handles about 181,000 vehicles a day. While the units involved in the reported boycott are relatively small, buses are typically charged about double the toll fees of smaller automobiles like cars and vans. Certainly there will be a reduction, it would be nave to say revenues will not be reduced, Bonoan said in an interview, while declining to elaborate. He noted that the company was taking steps to reassure motorists while providing non-structural safety measures. These include more signs warning drivers to be more cautious and additional patrol cars to enforce its rules. In its website, Skyway also warned drivers of buses and trucks to not to use the leftmost or passing lane of its 13.5-km at-grade road section from Magallanes to Alabang and its 16.4-km elevated tollway.",Miguel R.

2014-03-11,,,"Public officials, Government agencies","On December 16, 2013, a Don Mariano bus fell from the southbound lane of the South Luzon Expressways Skyway, killing 21 people and injuring 20 more. On Feb. 7, 2014, a total of 14 people died and 32 more were hospitalized when a Florida bus plunged into a ravine in the Cordillera mountains. And last Mar. 1, a coaster was rear-ended by an SUV and dropped from the same Skyway where the Don Mariano bus fell. Every time accidents like these happen, the population is jolted from lethargy and starts the analyzing and the finger-pointing. What the authorities and the experts say amuses me: The roads are unsafe, the contractor fouled up the project, the road railings are too low, or the vehicle was unsafe, or it was the fault of the driver. Why so reactive? We are no longer in the 19th century when mankind had to wait for something to happen to make the necessary improvements. Havent anybody heard of the hierarchy of safety controls yet? No matter how well-conditioned the vehicles or how well-paved the roads are, the human factor or human error always lurks around a driver behind the wheel. Instead of arguing that the road railing design is similar to the railings installed in other countries or conform to standards, why dont we just review the design of what were installed and think of how we can improve it. Standards are just the minimum requirements and serve as a guide; nothing prevents anybody from coming up with designs that go over and above the minimum requirements, much so if it is so warranted. So why not engineer that human error out by designing something that works? The Dec. 16, 2013, and the Mar. 1, 2014 incidents have proven us that the Skyway railing is not effective, so why stick to that design? Let us challenge what exists. One accident is one too many.

2014-03-13,,,"Manila North Tollways Corporation, Philippine Economic Zone Authority","A few days ago the company called Manila North Tollways Corp. launched the second segment of its P12-billion project known as the port connector road, linking the congested Manila port area with NLExyes, the North Luzon Expressway. A company in the Metro Pacific group of MVP (Manuel V. Pangilinan), MNTC actually operates NLEx. We all know that NLEx is the one and only highway between Metro Manila and the crop-rich northern Luzon. Really, NLEx is a critical infrastructure. The company actually split the connector road into two phases: The 2.4-kilometer stretch from NLEx to the McArthur Highway in Valenzuela, and from there the 5.6-kilometer mostly elevated road all the way to the port area. The P1.7-billion first phase is scheduled to be operational this July and the bigger P10.5-billion segment is targeted for completion in 2016, or hopefully still during the term of our dear leader Benigno Simeon, aka BS. Through the connector road, anyway, MNTC obviously wanted to link NLExdirectlywith the cargo-heavy clientele in the port area, possibly also as a way to decongest traffic in some parts of Metro Manila. For one, based on MNTC estimates, the connector road can actually accommodate at least 30,000 cargo trucks daily, and at present the daily volume in North Harbor comes up to only about 12,000 trucks. According to MNTC president and CEO Rodrigo Franco, the connector road can actually ease traffic in Caloocan, Malabon, Navotas and Valenzuela, not to mention specific sites such as the Balintawak-Cubao stretch of Edsa. To think, MNTC is spending only about P12 billion for the two phases of such a key road project, even considering the high cost of the elevated portion running above the train tracks of the Philippine National Railway. What a blessing it will be for the traffic-weary commuters in Metro Manila! Like it or not, the answer to the traffic problem in the metropolis has always been the construction of new roads and new infrastructureyou know, things like elevated roads, light rails, tunnels and flyovers. Yet almost four years into the Aquino (Part II) administration, with only about two years left in the term of our dear leader BS, we have yet to enjoy the sight of even just a single major infrastructure designed to ease our suffering. So far the MMDA still espouses the wrong approach that we can actually solve our enormous traffic problem, only by reducing the number of vehicles in the streets through the so-called unified vehicular volume reduction program, or the UVVRP. Studies already showed that the program did not work. It only served to increase the traffic volume on the roads in the metropolis because it encouraged people to buy more vehicles to avoid the number coding, thus tying up more capital into vehicles that otherwise could have gone to other means of production. It eventually became an anti-poor program, precisely because only the moneyed class could afford to buy more and more vehicles. Recently, the City of Manila followed the example of the MMDA by banning cargo trucks in broad daylight, thinking perhaps that its ordinance would not serve to paralyze thousands of businesses. In only two days of the truck ban in Manila, according to reports, the Port of Manila and the Manila International Container Port already registered losses of P273 million and P217 million, respectively. Here is another worry: the Philippine Economic Zone Authority reported that some 800 export companies, employing more than 200,000 workers, also posted losses of $77 million a day since Manila imposed the truck ban. * * * Quietly without fanfare in the past few months, the PCSO has been shipping hundreds of thousands of emergency kits and packages of relief goods to various areas in the Visayas devastated by Super Typhoon Yolanda. We also know that the agency already announced that it would shoulder the hospital expenses of the Yolanda victims who were confined in public hospitals and healthcare facilities. Those things might not be surprising at all because they were actually the job of the PCSO, based at least on its mandate. But the thing is this: PCSO chair Margie Juico has been going hands-on in the PCSO program to help the typhoon victims. I heard that she personally went around the Visayas to talk to local officials to find out how the agency could help the victims most effectively. Last week, for instance, Juico held dialogues with local officials of Palawan, who actually requested medicines and ambulancesmore than the usual relief operations. From what I gathered, the agency also remitted some P12 billion in taxes to the Bureau of Internal Revenue, or P10.5 billion in documentary stamp taxes plus some P1.7 billion in deficiency taxes of past management of the PCSO. By the way, as a policy under the Aquino (Part II) administration, the PCSO wanted to be up-to-date in its tax payments, which was hardly the case in many other government outfits, particularly those government corporations involved in the pork barrel scams. Anyway, the Civil Service Commission recently cited the PCSO for excellent public service, after a year of survey done by the commission among all government offices. Actually, the commission included all the 17 branches and offices of the PCSO, with 14 of them receiving positive ratings and two with excellent rating, namely, the Lung Center satellite unit and the Tarlac provincial office.",Conrado R.

2014-03-14,,,Transport sector leaders,"MANILA, Philippines  The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) suspended for six months the operations of the GV Florida Transport after it was found that one of its buses had faulty brakes, which resulted in the death of 14 passengers when it plunged into a ravine in Bontoc in February. According to television and reports, LTFRB chairman Winston Ginez said the findings showed that brake malfunction caused the GV Florida Transport bus to lose its control and tumble down a ravine in Bontoc, Mountain Province last Feb. 7. This confirmed the preliminary investigation of LTFRB that the bus had loose brakes. The board also found out that the bus was authorized under the name of Norberto Cue, who had not filed an approval for the sale and transfer to Florida Transport. This means that the Florida Transport was not authorized to operate the bus, LTFRB said. The LTFRB suspended all the 188 buses of the Florida for six months over the accident, reports said. Among those killed were comedian Arvin Tado Jimenez, musician David Sicam, visual artist Gerard Baja, and 11 others. Meanwhile, 32 were injured including the driver and the conductor.

2014-03-15,,,,"If it aint broke, dont fix itunless you just want to make money. A senator is questioning the plan of the Department of Transportation and Communications to replace some nine million vehicular license plates nationwide starting next month, a move supposedly aimed at curbing car theft. Sen. Ralph Recto wondered why the DOTC had decided to replace even plates that were still in good condition. Why replace all? Whats wrong with my plate and your plate? Whats wrong with those plate numbers? Theres nothing wrong with them, he said in an Inquirer interview. The lawmaker is a member of the Senate committee on public services that conducted a hearing Tuesday on the delays in the issuance of plates by the Land Transportation Office, an attached agency of the DOTC. The LTO earlier announced that it would issue plates of new designs. Plates for private vehicles, for example, will contain three control letters and four digits (like ZDR 4422), while motorcycle plates will have two control letters and five digits (like BB 12345). Plates for public utility vehicles will have three control letters and four digits. While causing a hassle and extra expenses on the part of vehicle owners who have to line up at the LTO, the senator said, the project would surely make a fortune for the favored supplier of the new plates. It looks like business, he said, and the captive market would be the vehicle owners who must cough up P450 each for a pair of new plates. Of this amount, P380 goes to the manufacturer while P70 goes to the DOTC as administration fee. As to the DOTCs explanation that the new plates would improve a cars security against theft, Recto said: A plate can never be a talisman or an anticarnapping device. Even (congressmens) cars that bear the No. 8 plates get stolen. But in a joint statement Friday, the DOTC and LTO maintained that the new license plates would have safety features such as tamper-proof bolts that would permanently attach them to the vehicle, reflectorized sheeting to make them visible even from a distance and from any angle; and a third-plate sticker which would display the plate numbers on windshields and could not be torn off without leaving a trace. These features would curb illegal or colorum operations that become possible when plates are easily removed and transferred to another vehicle, the agencies said, noting that car theft syndicates had been known to engage in such schemes. The new plates would also come with road discipline features to help authorities spot traffic or franchise violations. Protocol plates issued to members of Congress, for example, will also indicate their term of office. It will therefore be easier to tell if an expired plate is still being used beyond the lawmakers term. We believe that public officials will appreciate these new features, since we should all lead by example, Transport Secretary Joseph Abaya said in the statement. The department also clarified a few points regarding the cost of the plates. The new license plates will still cost the same: P450 for 4-wheel vehicles and P120 for motorcycles. These are the current prices, so its not correct to say that they will cost more. New vehicle owners, (or) those who will register their vehicles for the first time beginning Feb. 17 this year, will be charged the same rate as everyone else before, Abaya added. The additional cost will be for owners of the current license plates, who will have to pay those amounts to get the new designs. But this is a one-time payment only. In exchange, we get many security features which will improve the safety of our families and loved ones, he added. For public utility vehicles, their license plates will indicate the region where the registration was made. Public utility buses will also bear the label city bus or provincial bus, and their third plate sticker will reflect their authorized routes. These will help improve road discipline and safety. They will enable traffic enforcers to apprehend PUVs that violate their franchises. Legitimate PUV operators should welcome this since colorum vehicles will be weeded out, Abaya stressed.",,", | 12:34 AM | Saturday, March 15th, 2014","Department of Transportation and Communication, LTO, Senate",yes,2014-03-15 00:00:00,"enforcement of existing lawsordinances,new license plates",,,,,Recto sees business scheme; Abaya cites added security,,,english,,http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/585684/dotc-car-plates-project-slammed,,,text,,62.0,,2438.0,,mavie,,,"license plates, traffic enforcement and violations",7.5,Straight News,,,,,,inquirer,no,,,,,DOTC car plates project slammed | Inquirer News,Neutral,,

2014-03-18,,death:1,"Government agencies, Transport sector leaders","""Suwerte lang."" This is how Charley Sta. Maria described her survival when the bus she was on fell down a deep ravine in Bontoc town in Mountain Province last month. ""Meron akong muscle trauma. Medyo mahirap din huminga paminsan-minsan dahil sa pagbugbog ng katawan pero otherwise ako 'yung pinakahindi na-injure,"" Sta. Maria said in a live interview on GMA News TV's ""News To Go"" on Tuesday.  She was seated in the middle section of the bus and was filming the sunrise just minutes before the crash happened. Asked if there had been any indication that the bus was in trouble, she said, ""Naririnig ko 'yung kambyo na ayaw kumagat, 'saka naaamoy ko rin 'yung goma na nasusunog."" Sta. Maria was one of a group of artists who boarded the G.V. Florida bus to head to Kalinga. Among those from her group who died were musician and artist David Sicam, comedian Tado Jimenez, and visual artist Gerard Baja. Sta. Maria said that before the bus fell down the 100- to 120-meter-deep ravine, the passengers were shouting that the conducter had fallen from the bus. It was later discovered that he had jumped off just before the bus plunged down the ravine. After the crash, Sta. Maria's first instinct was to call their guide to ask for help. Luckily, her boyfriend, who was also not seriously injured, had his phone inside his jacket pocket and they were able to call for help. The survivors and the families of those killed in the crash later started an online petition, , demanding justice for the victims and reforms in the country's transport system. ""Sana lahat ng bus operators hindi nila unahing isipin ang kikitain nila. Sana isipin din nila na napakalaki ng responsibilidad nila sa mamamayan,"" said Sta. Maria. She added that the survivors and the victims' families have been meeting every week since the crash to plan their next action. ""Gusto namin kumuha ng suporta sa lahat ng mga kapwa manlalakbay, kapwa travelers na suportahan ang petitsyon namin sa change.org. Gusto naming ipakita na binabantayan namin 'yung tamang pamalalakad ng transportasyon dito sa Pilipinas,"" she explained. Sta. Maria wants the Land Transportation and Franchising Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to make ""little"" reforms in the system, including drivers' training and seat belts for provincial buses. ""Gusto namin tumulong sa LTO [Land Transportation Office] and LTFRB,"" she added. In an interview with GMA News Online, LTFRB spokesperson Mary Ann Salada said that the board is open to suggestions. ""We had a board meeting with them to hear their side. Their input falls under policy matters. Although the board has an independent mind, their inputs will be recommendatory,"" she said, referring to the survivors and the victims' families. Salada said that the LTFRB will be implementing road safety projects, including: Sta. Maria, meanwhile, chided the GV Florida bus company for failing to issue a public apology to the survivors and the victims' families. ""Wala akong naririnig na public apology galing sa kanila,"" she said. ""Ang approach lang sa akin ng attorney [ng GV Florida], 'Ma'am, pasensya na po.' They take it too lightly. Masyadong conversational, parang hindi niyo ba naiintindihan 'yan? Ang laki ng nagawa niyo 'yung responsibilidad niyo na hindi niyo ginawa,"" she lamented. ""Sa pagmamadali niyong kumita ng pera, 'di niyo inisip 'yung kapakanan ng pasahero,"" she added. The day after the crash, LTFRB issued a 30-day preventive suspension on the bus company. It later issued a six-month suspension and revoked its franchise to ply the route where the fatal incident occurred. Salada noted that the board is looking to issue a ""provisional authority"" to other bus companies to aid the passengers on the Bontoc route affected by GV Florida's franchise revocation.

2014-03-18,,,"Government agencies, Transport sector leaders","The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) will soon require bus companies in Metro Manila to install on each bus a device that would set off an alarm if the bus goes over the speed limit. The device will use GPS (Global Positioning System) and will alert the passengers if the bus is speeding. ""The Board will come up with a memorandum circular by May 1 which will require Metro Manila city buses to install GPS with a speeding alarm,"" LTFRB spokesperson Mary Ann Salada told GMA News Online in a phone interview on Tuesday. The board aims to implement the regulation for provincial buses as well, Salada noted. However, she declined to disclose how much installing GPS system would cost per bus. Salada explained that this is the LTFRB's answer to the ""intensifying public clamor"" regarding road accidents, especially those involving buses. ""The need for this gadget was emphasized following the bus crashes,"" she said, referring to the in Bontoc in February and in Taguig in December. Salada added that the GPS project has been in the pipeline even before the fatal incidents occurred.

2014-03-18,,,"Government agencies, Transport sector leaders","MANILA  Rolando Laurio, the driver of Mayamy bus that through seven vehicles along Commonwealth Avenue in Quezon City last March 1, has submitted his sworn affidavit to the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). In his affidavit, Laurio said he crashed into at least seven vehicles and the highway's center island after avoiding a pregnant woman on board a motorcycle. At least 11 were injured in the multiple collision. A dark-colored Tamaraw FX, a Toyota Vios, an Urvan, an L-300, a Mazda 3, a UV Express van and a Ford Lynx were damaged in the collision. Due to the accident, Laurio was slapped with a charge of reckless imprudence resulting in multiple physical injuries. The LTFRB subsequently imposed on March 5 a 30-day preventive suspension against Mayamy's franchise covering five units plying the route of Norzagaray, Bulacan to Baclaran via Commonwealth Avenue. Mayamy Trans told the LTFRB that it has shouldered the cost of repairing the damaged road center island. It said it has also settled the hospital bills of the injured victims. The bus firm is asking for more time to complete the submission of results of motor vehicle inspections of the units in question, and documents proving that the bus company's drivers and conductors have already undergone re-training and drug testing. A decision on whether to revoke the franchise will be made by the LTFRB on or before the end of the 30-day preventive suspension order. Meanwhile, the LTFRB has started giving special permits for additional trips for buses in preparation for the Holy Week exodus. The LTFRB said those who will apply should secure valid franchise documents, mandatory passenger accident insurance. LTFRB also said it will soon open special permit applications for buses to ply routes of the suspended buses of GV Florida Transport. It was found out that GV Florida is the only bus company that offers trips to Cagayan.

2014-03-21,,,,"Many words have been said about the GV Florida bus that fell off a ravine in Bontoc, Mountain Province, last Feb. 7. Approximately six months before the fatal accident, the Department of Public Works and Highways-Cordillera Autonomous Region (DPWH-CAR) bid out two projects, each worth P5 million, for the installation of safety devicesone for the Dantay-Sagada road, and the other for the Bontoc-Ifugao road. Under one of these two projects, guardrails were supposed to have been installed on the road section where a GV Florida bus fell. There is talk that the project contractor has already received his 15-percent (or P750,000) mobilization funds (advance payment). However, the project has not been started. Had guardrails been installed in that road section, maybe the bus would not have fallen off the ravine and/or there would have been fewer fatalities. One other point: It appears that whoever in the DPWH-CAR designed the project (installation of road safety devices), he/she/they are not experienced or seasoned drivers, otherwise they would have known the specific sections that needed guardrails. Drive around Mountain Province and you will see so many installed guardrails that are just a waste of government money. The DPWH-CAR and the DPWH-Mountain Province District Engineering Office act as if they are merely reactionary forces. They do install guardrails in accident sites but only after an accident? An honest-to-goodness investigation on the accident will give justice to those who perished in that accident. May they rest in peace. JUNIPER C.

2014-03-22,,injured:50,Vehicle users,"MANILA, PhilippinesA mad rush by a bus driver to pick up passengers ended in a three-bus smash-up that injured at least 50 people at a bus stop on Commonwealth Avenue in Quezon City early Saturday morning, police said. Among those injured were the three bus drivers, who were under custodial investigation following the accident at the Philcoa area. Superintendent Ely Pintang, head of the Quezon City Police Districts Traffic Enforcement Unit, said the injured victims were being treated at the East Avenue Medical Center. He said the accident happened at 5:55 a.m. at a bus stop on the westbound side of Commonwealth Avenue, near the Elliptical Road in Barangay Old Capitol Site. Traffic Sector 5 head Chief Insp. Narciso Cajipe Jr. said that prior to the smash-up, a Marikina Auto Line Transit bus (VVT 155) driven by Anthony Malangan, 58, had stopped to unload passengers. Another bus, Safeway (UVJ 465) driven by Clifford Reyes, 28, was in front, waiting for passengers. Suddenly, a speeding Nova Auto Transport bus (TWL 693) driven by Mario Rogelio Jr., 27 came from behind and sidewiped the left side of the Marikina Auto Line Transit bus and then rear-ended the Safeway bus. Pintang said the speeding bus was apparently in a hurry to pick up more passengers at the loading bay. They are racing to load more passengers, thats why the bus miscalculated and hit the two buses ahead of him, Pintang said. Cajipe said investigators were checking the extent of the injuries of the victims, although no one was in critical condition as of Saturday afternoon. He said Rogelio faced several counts of reckless imprudence resulting in physical injuries. According to a radio report, the driver of Nova Auto Transport bus fled the scene but turned himself in to the police after a few hours. While the driver was away from the scene, the report said he managed to grab breakfast first due of nervousness before he surrendered to the authorities.

The city government said it has conducted consultations with stakeholders before the Skyway Stage 3 construction along SLEX-Sergio Osmea Avenue starts on April 15. In a post on its website, the city government said this stage of and may affect traffic in barangays along Osmea Avenue and Kalayaan Avenue. (W)e are preparing traffic plans that would aid motorists and commuters in reaching their destination faster despite the closure of some lanes. Sidewalks will also be constructed wherever possible in order to keep the pedestrians safe, Mayor Jejomar Erwin Binay Jr. said. Allso, it noted Osmea Avenue is one of the four entry-and exit points in Makati with an average volume of 115,000 vehicles passing daily, along with EDSA, C5 and Roxas Boulevard. For now, the city plans to use some streets for traffic rerouting and diversion in Barangays San Isidro, San Antonio, Poblacion, Bel-Air, Bangkal, Sta. Cruz, Palanan, Olympia, Pio del Pilar and La Paz. Also discussed in the meetings was the synchronization of road projects of various government and private entities for a well-coordinated traffic management plan. This include the retrofitting and rehabilitation of Magallanes Interchange, FPIC gas pipeline relocation, huge double barrel box culvert by MMDA, smaller box culvert by DPWH-MMII District Engineering Office, and Manila Waters water pipeline. Binay said the city government will announce the final traffic management plan after it reviews the traffic plans and rerouting schemes. Participants in the dialogues included representatives of the Department of Public Works and Highways, Metropolitan Manila Development Authority, Philippine National Railways, Citra Expressway Central Corporation, Toll Regulatory Board, Manila Water, FPIC, First Balfour/PIC, Ayala Land Inc., and Makati Parking Authority. The city government said the DPWH has proposed a rerouting scheme for light vehicles, with buses and trucks to take the regular route. Also, the DPWH will post traffic signs and directions along the route and at the worksite itself. Meanwhile, the DPWH will start engineering works on the Magallanes Interchange this Saturday. This will involve asphalt overlay, strengthening of the structure, and repair of expansion joints. ""The overall work will be done in phases on the different levels of the Interchange, some simultaneously, and from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. to avoid heavy traffic congestion. FPIC will also start its work on the gas pipeline relocation on Saturday to make way for the construction of a DPWH box culvert,"" the city government said.

2014-03-23,,,Public officials,"A lawmaker is proposing the creation of bike lanes on major roads all over the country in a bid to encourage the public to leave their cars at home and ride a bike to work. House Bill 3952, filed by Davao City Representative Karlo Alexei Nograles last February, seeks the creation of the local bikeways office (LBO), which shall be responsible for identifying roads and highways to be provided with bike lanes. The LBO will be mandated to plan and manage the construction of bikeways on all thoroughfares and roads within its jurisdiction. The project will be implemented in coordination with the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), Land Transportation Office (LTO) and other related government agencies. Funds for the creation of bikeways and other related infrastructure such as bicycle parks and bike parking areas shall come from 30 percent of the revenues raised by local government units from the miscellaneous activities like parking and license fees. Should the proposal become a law, the LBO will be required to create a procedure for bike registration. The records of registered bikers shall be kept and maintained by the proposed government agency. Under HB 3952, bikers will face fines of up to P10,000 if they violate certain traffic rules, such as carrying more passengers than what the vehicle is designated to hold in the absence of a regular seat or trailer towed by the bicycle. Nograles said in the bills explanatory note that the creation of bicycle lanes in the entire Philippines will help promote riding bikes among the public, which in turn will contribute to the protection of the environment and lesser traffic. Bicycle riding not only promotes health and leisure, but will also provide [an] , increasing fares, traffic, noise and air pollution and the high cost of vehicles, he said. Although the Metro Manila Development Authority has been constructing bicycle lanes in some major thoroughfares in Metro Manila since 2012, majority of the roads are still dedicated for the use of motor vehicles. The lack of bike lanes is said to be one of the reasons why only a few Filipinos bike to work or their other destinations, compared to other countries. Last February, a group of lawyers, environmental activists and community groups trooped to the Senate building in Pasay City to submit a draft bill that seeks to require local officials to build bigger sidewalks and bike lanes in their respective areas. Under the draft bill submitted by The Share The Road movement, 30 percent of public roads shall be used for sidewalks, while another 30 percent should be designated as bike lanes.

2014-03-24,,hurt:45,," MANILA  At least 45 people were injured in a bus accident along South Luzon Expressway (SLEx) in Sta. Rosa, Laguna on Monday morning. A Southern Commuter Carrier bus carrying at least 48 passengers from Lipa, Batangas, turned over along SLEx's northbound lane after its right rear tires were dislodged near Sta. Rosa exit at around 6:45 a.m. Reports gathered by Radio dzMM's Dennis Datu said that 21 people were brought to Bian Doctors Hospital; 15 to Perpetual Help Medical Center; and 9 to San Jose Hospital and Trauma Center. Authorities have yet to confirm whether bus driver Sulpicio Marasigan was among those injured. The bus conductor, identified as Lloyd Martin Supillo, is now under the custody of Philippine National Police  Highway Patrol Group. Bus passenger Edgar Lagrimas, meanwhile, said one of the female passengers beside him had her hand severed due to the strong impact of the crash. ""Normal naman ang takbo ng bus, tapos biglang naputol iyung gulong niya sa likuran so nag-turn turtle siya, iyung katabi ko nga naputol ang kamay niya,"" Lagrimas told dzMM. ""Ako nasa gitnang upuan kaya medyo galos lang,"" he added. The female passenger was among the nine brought to San Jose Hospital and Trauma Center in Calamba, Laguna. Another female passenger who was brought to Bian Doctors Hospital had her face badly scraped due to the crash. Passengers noted that the bus was not overspeeding and overloaded when the accident occurred. They attributed the crash to the poor condition of the vehicle. Investigators said they found an empty sachet of suspected shabu and drug paraphernalia, and several empty bottles of alcoholic drinks inside the bus. They will also look into allegations that the bus was a colorum unit, after a ""RRCG Bus"" marking was found on its rear portion. The accident snarled traffic in both SLEx's northbound and southbound lanes. The bus, which was bound for Taft Avenue, blocked three lanes of SLEx after it tumbled.

2014-03-24,,,,"For some bus operators from southern Luzon traveling on roads going to and from Manila, pictures simply paint a thousand words. In a motion and reply submitted to the Supreme Court, a group of bus operators led by Angeles Bayot has included 23 photographs showing that the government's newly introduced Southwest Interim Transport Terminal (SITT) did not meet international standards and would only make things harder for travelers. ""These photos clearly show that the questioned bus terminal is far from the 'international standards' of a public terminal,"" said the petitioners, who even sent one of their lawyer, Antonio Carlos Bayot, to personally inspect the terminal in Paraaque City earlier this month. One of the photos showed the terminal being surrounded by makeshift structures, such as carinderias and other stalls, which could ""serve as hotspots for bystanders, and even drug users/pushers."" Another one showed garbage, rubble and debris scattered around the terminal, exposing passengers to pollution and health hazards. ""Surroundings of the SITT appear to be more like dumpsites rather than a 'world class' terminal for commuters. Considering Uniwide Coastal Malls dilapidated facilities and condition, it is very questionable why respondents agreed to lease these premises,"" the petitioners said, adding that an asphalt plant can also be found near the terminal. Other photos showed that island bays for waiting passengers are ""squeezed"" between buses with a space of only around ""two to three feet."" ""Amidst the long queue of buses, bystanders are totally oblivious of the hazards/accidents waiting to happen... (of the) danger they are in because of the very small distance between them and the moving buses,"" they said.  The terminal also has a low ceiling and is ""very dark, small, and filled with smoke/fumes from the diesel emission of buses. ""Literally, the smoke inside the SITT is so bad that one cannot stay for 5 minutes without getting dizzy or immediately developing cough,"" the petitioners said, even suggesting that the Department of Health should study the pollution levels inside the terminal. ""Surely, this kind of a facility is very harmful for the health of those sick, disabled, pregnant women, infants, children, and senior citizens,"" the petitioners said. Another photo showed that the long lines of buses waiting to be dispatched are contributing to heavy and ""monstrous"" traffic in surrounding area, like the Diosdado Macapagal Blvd., Coastal Road, and Roxas Blvd. The controversial transport policy prevents provincial public utility buses from entering the National Capital Region. Buses using the Coastal Road or Manila-Cavite Expressway are barred from entering beyond Paraaque City. These buses are required to end their routes at the Southwest Interim Transport Terminal at the Uniwide Coastal Mall in Baclaran, Paraaque City. Commuters have to transfer to city buses or other public utility vehicles operating within the city. The petitioners who are commuters from Cavite travelling daily to work in Manila have earlier asked the high court to issue a temporary restraining order or a status quo ante order against three orders related to the newly-introduced transport policy, namely: The commuters said commuters coming from the south had to shell out extra money to reach their destinations in Metro Manila. It said implementing the contested policy is similar to directly imposing taxes on commuters.

Dapat sagutin nila paano na makakapagtrabaho iyan,"" said her father, Alberto Marcelino. More than 20 people were hurt in the bus crash. A CCTV video shows light traffic along the northbound lane of the South Luzon Expressway shortly before 7 a.m. Monday. Suddenly, a Southern Carrier bus fell on its side after two of its wheels came off. The bus was heading to Makati from Lipa, Batangas. It was carrying 45 people, with many of them on their way to work. ""Bigla na lang natanggal iyung gulong sa likuran, nag-turtle siya. Katabi ko yung babae naputol yung kamay niya,"" said bus passenger Edgar Lagrimas. Eighteen-year-old Richard Litan, who was going to UP Manila, was also hurt. ""I heard a suspicious sound sa gulong. Hindi siya naagapan ng driver. Nagising lang ako sa time nag-sway iyung bus. Napatama po siya sa concrete,"" he said. Authorities say it's possible the bus was not well-maintained, which is why its two wheels came off. But an RRCG inspector said all Southern Carrier buses undergo inspections. RRGC is a sister company of Southern Carrier. The bus driver, Sulpicio Marasigan, fled after the accident. Police said they found a beer bottle and drug paraphernalia near marasigan's seat. However, in a statement, Southern Carrier said it strictly prohibits alcohol and illegal drugs. Southern Carrier also said it will shoulder the medical expenses of the injured passengers.

2014-03-25,,,,"MANILA -- The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) will launch its ""bike-kadahan"" scheme on Wednesday in time for the opening of the bicycle lane on EDSA in Quezon City. Under the ""bike-kadahan,"" which means bicycle-sharing, interested riders may use bicycles provided by the MMDA for free. They just have to present a valid identification card in exchange for a card indicating the bike number. This card should be surrendered at the exit area where the bike will be returned. ""The 'bike-kadahan' is designed to promote the use of bicycles as an alternative mode of transportation,"" MMDA Chairman Francis Tolentino said. Small trailer trucks will also be utilized to serve as mobile bicycle shelters on designated bicycle lanes in various parts of Metro Manila. Tolentino said riders can leave their own bicycles for free at these shelters, which will be manned by MMDA personnel. The trailer truck can accommodate up to 50 bicycles, he said. The new bicycle lane that will be opened tomorrow spans about 2.105 kilometers from Ortigas to Santolan (northbound) along EDSA. A similar bike lane along White Plains from EDSA to Temple Drive (eastbound) about 982.6-meters long will also be opened tomorrow. The new lanes are painted in red markings and have been installed with traffic directional signs and safety devices to aid bike riders.

2014-03-25,,,,"MANILA - The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has denied the motion of several transport groups for a P0.50 provisional fare increase for public utility jeepneys (PUJs) due to lack of merit. The motion for issuance of a P0.50 provisional fare increase for the first 4 kilometers was filed last February 15 by the Alliance of Concerned Transport Organization (ACTO), Federation of Jeepney Operators and Drivers Association of the Philippines (FEJODAP), Pangkahalatang Sangguniang Metro Manila and Suburb Association (PASANG-MASDA), Alliance of Transport Operations and Drivers Association of the Philippines (ALTODAP), and the Liga ng mga Tsuper at Operator sa Pilipinas, Inc. (LTOP). The Board denied the transport groups' request, with LTFRB chairman Winston Ginez pointing out that the prices of diesel fuel in Metro Manila have remained below the P45 per liter level. He said a report submitted by Petron during the public hearing last February 21 showed that prices of diesel fuel in Metro Manila have not breached the P45 per liter level since May 2012 until January 4, 2013. It can be recalled that on March 20, 2012, the Board granted a provisional P0.50 increase on jeepney fare when the diesel fuel price reached P57 per liter. But the LTFRB recalled the order on May 14, 2012 when the diesel prices was reduced to P45 level. Data from the DOE also showed that prices of diesel fuel also remained below the P45 per liter level from September to December 2013. Ginez said there has been a series of rollback on fuel prices. As of March 4 this year, there has been a decrease of P0.30 per liter on diesel fuel, and just last week, oil firms again reduced fuel prices due to downward adjustments in the international market, with diesel prices trimmed by an additional P0.70 per liter, he said. ""Under Section 16 (c) of the Public Service Law, it is the duty of the Board to take into account and balance the rights of the commuting public and the rights of the Operator-Grantee. We are aware that any fare adjustment creates a direct effect in the rise of cost of living, which in return affects both the commuting public and goods being transported,"" he said. On December 11, 2013, the transport groups also filed a petition for an increase in the minimum fare from P8 to P10 and an increase of P0.35 for every succeeding kilometers in NCR and Regions III and IV. The petition, however, was also denied by the LTFRB. ""Batid namin ang kalagayan ng ating mga jeepney drivers pero we appeal to them to follow our decision. Otherwise, we will be forced to impose sanctions on transport groups that will defy the Board's order not to increase minimum fares,"" Ginez said.",,ABS-CBNnews.com,,yes,2014-03-25 00:00:00,jeepney minimum fare,,,,,,,,english,,http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/03/25/14/ltfrb-nixes-p050-jeepney-fare-hike,,"metro manila, manila",text,,721.0,,294.0,,pia,,,jeepney fare,4.5,Straight News,,,,,,abs-cbnnews,no,,,,,LTFRB nixes P0.50 jeepney fare hike,,,

2014-03-27,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesThe Department of Public Works and Highways is pushing back the April 21 bid submission deadline for the 47-kilometer Cavite-Laguna Expressway (Calax) by a month as several bidders sought an extension. The new bid deadline has been set on May 21, according to two bidders who have received notifications from the DPWH. There are four groups vying for the P35.4-billion public-private partnership (PPP) deal, which aims to decongest traffic along the Cavite-Laguna road network and reduce travel time to and from Metro Manila. Sought for comment, Public Works and Highways Undersecretary Rafael Yabut confirmed the extension but said a final bid bulletin was still being finalized. He declined to elaborate. The extension comes as bidders have raised several issues on the auction of the tollroad, one of the biggest deals under the governments PPP program thus far. One of the bidders, MTD Philippines, was wary about how the offers would be evaluated, its president Isaac David said on Wednesday. He said the DPWHs bid parameters for the tollroad were the lowest viability fund gap, a type of subsidy, or the highest concession fee. David, who used to head that company that operates the South Luzon Expressway in Metro Manila, said bids were typically evaluated using the lowest toll fee, which would also benefit motorists more. As a concessionaire, lowest toll fee is preferred than lowest VGF [viability fund gap], David said. The lower the toll fee, the more affordable it will be to motorists and therefore more volume of vehicles, he said, adding that using subsidies or premiums as bid parameters would benefit the government over motorists who would eventually use the tollroad. David said a greenfield project like Calax required subsidies to be feasible, which he noted was confirmed by DPWH studies. He noted that the government appeared to be hoping to avoid spending the P5-billion subsidy allocated for the PPP project. Bidders offering a premium, instead of asking for a subsidy, were more likely to bag the project. It appears the DPWH is hoping to achieve similar results as in the Naia Expressway, David added, referring to the PPP deal San Miguel Corp. bagged last year after offering an P11-billion premium against the only other bidder, Metro Pacific Investments, which offered a P305-million premium. The DPWH is expecting construction of the Calax to start in October next year with completion seen in September 2017, information posted on its website showed. It will start from the Manila-Cavite Expressway in Kawit, Cavite, and end at the SLEx-Mamplasan Interchange in Bian, Laguna. Apart from MTD Philippines, the other prequalified bidders are Metro Pacific Tollways Corp., San Miguel Corp. and the tandem of the Ayala and Aboitz groups.",Miguel R.

2014-04-01,,,,"ILOILO CITYEddie Capio reached this city from his hometown in Leon, Iloilo province, on Sunday, pedaling a distance of 28 kilometers to travel 24 km farther in a mass cycling and running event on the city streets. This is just for fun and we hope we send out the message, said Capio, 53, a cyclist for 10 years. He was with some 2,000 enthusiasts who joined the 1st Iloilo Bike Festival to promote the Share the Road movement. Around 100 others joined a fun run. The road-sharing movement, pioneered in the country by environmental lawyer Antonio Oposa Jr., advocates the delineation of roads into those for vehicles and for pedestrians, runners and cyclists. I laud the Ilonggo because what you have shown here will not only be emulated in the rest of the country but will be a spark fire for a change of our mindset, Oposa, a 2009 Ramon Magsaysay awardee, said in a message during the opening program. This is the first time Ive seen so many [cyclists] in an event. Its important to promote a healthy lifestyle and to be physically active, Capio said. I hope events like these can help widen the consciousness of people that biking is not just for leisure but important for good health. We are proud that Iloilo is taking the lead. Capio, who came with 50 other cyclists from Leon and other towns, said he supported having more bike lanes and walks. The festival participants passed by 14 tourist and heritage sites, including the 54-hectare Iloilo Business Park project of Megaworld Corp. in Mandurriao District where the fun ride kicked off and ended. The route included Lizares Mansion, Casa Mariquit, Jaro plaza, cathedral and belfry, Sanson-Montinola house, Nelly Garden, Museo Iloilo, the old provincial capitol and Arroyo Fountain, Calle Real, Fort San Pedro, Plaza Libertad, City Hall, San Jose Church and Sto. Rosario heritage houses, Customs House, Molo Church and Iloilo River Esplanade. Streets along the route were closed to vehicular traffic. The fun ride lasted four hours and ended with a food festival and street party at Iloilo Business Park. Mayor Jed Patrick Mabilog, who joined the cyclists, led the ceremonial countdown. Iloilo Rep. Jerry Treas and other city officials, including councilors, attended. Senate President Franklin Drilon, the main guest, said the activity was timely amid the growing concern about the environment. All of us are concerned in making our respective communities a better place to live in, he said in a speech. Drilon said the bike festival complemented ongoing government and private sector projects that help make Iloilo a clean, safe and environment-friendly city. He cited the 14-km circumferential road connecting Arevalo District in Iloilo City and the coastal road in Dumangas town in Iloilo. The road network, which Drilon hopes to be named President Cory Aquino Avenue, will include a 2-meter painted bike lane. The road-widening project along the 10-km Sen. Benigno Aquino Jr. Avenue features a six-lane highway, a pedestrian lane and a 5-m paved bike lane that will extend from Barangay (village) Sambag in Jaro District in Iloilo City to Iloilo International Airport in Cabatuan town. We will probably be the first city with at least a 24-km bike lane, Drilon, a native of Iloilo and the main proponent of the projects, said. Megaworld, which hosted the event, said its P35-billion Iloilo Business Park would feature bike lanes and walk areas, including its 1.1-km Festive Walk. Jesyl Pasaporte, 24, a teacher from Jaro District in Iloilo City, came to the bike festival with her brother, nephews and nieces. This is a good way to promote a healthy lifestyle especially because many people tend to have a sedentary lifestyle due to computers, she told the Inquirer.

""He could have played longer if he had that passion and commitment to his career,"" Guiao added wistfully. ""But somehow, hindi na-realize yung full potential niya."" The current head coach of the Rain or Shine Elasto Painters however recalls his fondest memory of the player as, ""When he played for me sa Red Bull, there was one game sa quarterfinals wen he made a winning shot....That's really what stands out when I look back at his career with me.""

2014-04-03,,,,"MANILA - The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) is requesting the city government of Makati to secure the required special permit to continue offering free bus service for passengers from Quezon City to Ayala Avenue. The Board sent a letter on Wednesday to the office of Makati City Mayor Jejomar Jun-Jun Binay Jr., asking him to submit all documentary requirements for the permit. The Board may issue a special permit for a non-extendible period of three months from the date of issuance, the letter signed by LTFRB Board member, Engr. Ronald F. Corpus, stated. Corpus added in the letter that should the city decide to extend its services for more than three months, they need to submit a request for an extension of the authority to use transport services to the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) assistant secretary of planning. In order to get the special permit, the city government must submit four copies of a verified petition, original and copy of any valid government identification card of the authorized representative of Makati City, and copies of the official receipt (OR) and certificate of registration (CR) of the two buses and four coasters being used for the service. The city should also submit to LTFRB the original copy of the Personal Accident Liability Insurance issued by an LTFRB-accredited insurance group, and the original copy of Sangguniang Panglungsod Resolution authorizing the City to offer the public bus service, particularly for MRT passengers, from Quezon City to Makati City. We encourage the participation and cooperation of LGUs and other non-government sectors in helping solve the worsening traffic condition in the metropolis, LTFRB chairman Atty. Winston Ginez said. He added that while the Board appreciates the free service provided by the City of Makati, they also believe that there should be proper coordination in securing a valid bus permit to protect the riding public in case of an accident. Under Section 13 of the Public Service Law, the LTFRB has the jurisdiction, supervision, and control over all public services and their franchises, equipment, and other properties, and has the necessary powers, including security assistance. All public services owned or operated by government entities or government-owned or controlled corporations shall be regulated by the Board in the same way as privately-owned public services. Ginez said that the Board will swiftly act to process the city's application for a special permit as soon as they receive the required documents.

Dela Cruz was on his way to the same casino to fetch his father, whose shift also ended at 6 a.m. Tumulak said Dela Cruz fell asleep while driving because he had not had enough sleep following a party where he had a few drinks. Because of the impact, Bontilao and Lopez were thrown off the motorcycle and hit their heads on the pavement. They died on the spot, Tumulak said. The car went up the curb and hit two pedestrians on the sidewalk before it slammed into the fence of a restaurant. Injured were Roel Cadiz, 33, a native of Camotes Island, Cebu; and Danny Vale, 37, of Cebu City. Tumulak said Dela Cruz admitted he had been drinking with his friends until dawn Saturday and had a nap before setting out to fetch his father.

2014-04-04,,,," MANILA -- The Makati City government is questioning the move of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) requiring it to apply for a permit for its free bus rides. City officials are asking for a clarification on why they have to fill out a form for a special permit for out-of-line vehicles. Mayor Jejomar ""Junjun"" Binay Jr. said they are using government vehicles and not operating a franchise. He said they are rendering their services for free, and the passengers, including the driver, are covered by GSIS insurance. He added that such concerns should be coursed through the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG), which has jurisdiction over local government units. Binay clarified that they are willing to comply but with the right basis. They are planning to send a letter to LTFRB today asking them for clarification and explanation on the matter. Four coasters and two buses of the Makati City government ferry more or less 500 passengers from the MRT's North Avenue Station to the Philippine Stock Exchange building in Ayala Avenue with no stop-overs since March 27.  This was done to help reduce the number of passengers boarding the MRT following a series of problems with the railway last month. The LTFRB, for its part, clarified that the application for special permit being asked for the Makati free bus rides is to ensure the safety of the passengers. Any vehicle transporting the public must apply for the permit so the passengers will be covered by insurance, it said.",,"By Jacque Manabat, ABS-CBN News",,yes,2014-04-04 00:00:00,"enforcement of existing lawsordinances,public transportation regulation",,,,,,,,english,,http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/04/04/14/why-makati-needs-ltfrb-permit-free-bus-service,,makati,text,,717.0,,1547.0,,pia,,,"public transportation regulation, traffic enforcement and violations",4.5,-,,,,,,abs-cbnnews,no,,,,,Why Makati needs LTFRB permit for free bus service,,,

The opposing partiestaxi driver Glen Remetio and cousins Karlvin Ang and Bill Emerson Tan-Angagreed to settle the matter on Friday afternoon and withdraw the complaints filed earlier this week, according to Senior Insp. Virgilio Carodan of the Quezon City Police Districts Cubao station. We were informed that they were going to meet at the (Quezon City) Hall of Justice. When we arrived, the three were already shaking hands, Carodan told the Inquirer. Carodan said Emerson and Remetio apologized to each other for the traffic altercation, while Remetio also said sorry to Karlvin for dragging his name into the issue after he mistakenly identified him as the gun-toting man in the incident. But before reaching a happy ending, the case had already deteriorated into a three-cornered fight. Remetio, who first filed complaints against Karlvin for supposedly pointing a gun at him in a traffic altercation, was also sued by Emerson because he pulled a knife during the confrontation on Edsa-Santolan flyover. Emersons lawyer earlier maintained that Remetio sued the wrong man. Emerson filed a complaint for frustrated murder Thursday against Remetio in the Quezon City prosecutors office, a day after Remetio and the police filed charges for physical injuries, malicious mischief and grave threats against Karlvin. The July 25 incident was caught on amateur video that had since gone viral. The video, taken by a bus passenger using a camera phone, showed a man in a blue shirt and denim pants getting off a Mercedes Benz along with an older man, and arguing with Remetio while the latter was in his cab. Remetio was then seen pointing a knife at the man in blue, who prevented him from getting off the cab by repeatedly kicking the door.

2014-04-09,,,Government agencies,"LAGUNA, PhilippinesThe operator of the South Luzon Expressway (SLEx) is expecting heavy traffic during the Holy Week exodus, with the number of motorists peaking on Holy Wednesday and Maundy Thursday. SLEx Traffic and Security Manager Chito Silbol said they were expecting about 295,000 vehicles on each day, an increase of 10 to 15 percent from last year that reached 263,000 daily during the same period. The daily average of motorists taking the lone artery down south of Luzon is 240,000 on a regular day or when it is not a national holiday. Basically, (the projection is based on) the growing number of vehicles, he said in a phone interview Wednesday. As a remedy to the long queuing, particularly nearing SLEXs Calamba toll plaza and at the Ayala Greenfield toll, SLEx is opening counterflow lanes on the southbound lane on April 16 and 17, Holy Wednesday and Maundy Thursday, respectively, and on the northbound lane from April 19-21 (Black Saturday, Easter Sunday and Monday) in preparation for the influx of motorists returning to Manila. Silbol said they would also deploy additional ambulant tellers and put up motorist assistance desks on these dates to speed up traffic flow. The best way is to always plan your trip. When you know what to expect, you may avoid being caught in heavy traffic on these dates, Silbol said. Meanwhile, the Calabarzon (Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, Quezon) police, with 10,000 personnel, would deploy forces to tourist destinations, such as churches and beach areas, during the long holiday break, according to regional police director Chief Supt. Jesus Gatchalian. He said they have also coordinated with security personnel of private subdivisions to guard against burglars while the homeowners are on vacation. Silbol advised motorists to drive safely so as to prevent accidents being a burden to other motorists. Passengers of public utility vehicles, he said, should also be empowered to reprimand reckless and over speeding drivers. SLEx has recorded 102 road accidents in January this year, 80 in February, 73 in March, and 23 from April 1 to 4. While the number decreases, our target is always zero accident, Silbol said.

2014-04-09,,,,"The infernal traffic jam that motorists of Metro Manila and surrounding areas have to suffer daily was the subject of last Mondays Kapihan sa Manila at the Diamond Hotel. The guests were representatives of the Metro Manila Development Authority (Director Neomie Recio and engineer Emil Llavon of the Traffic Engineering Center, Gen. Frank Manalo of the Traffic Discipline Office, and Tina Velasco of the office of MMDA Chair Francis Tolentino) and of the Light Rail Transit Authority (Hernando T. Cabrera, corporate board secretary, and Annabelle Gananciel, manager of the business development and public relations department). It looks like we have to grin and bear it for at least one-and-a-half more years before we see any improvement in the traffic flow. The MMDA representatives said the agency is doing everything it can think of to ease the traffic jam. It has invested in smart traffic signals that can detect the volume of traffic on the streets. If traffic is heavier on one street, it will light the green signal on that street longer. It is clearing the streets and sidewalks of parked vehicles and other obstructions. However, its jurisdiction is only over national roads; the side streets are under the jurisdiction of the local government units. So dont blame the MMDA when side streets are clogged; blame your mayor. The MMDAs response to traffic accidents has been reduced to 15 minutes, according to its representatives. If it takes longer than that, blame the traffic jam (hahaha) that delays the traffic investigators. And the MMDA has revived the Pasig River ferry that should relieve some of the traffic load on the streets, But theres bad news for the Holy Weekthe only time of the year when traffic is light in Metro Manila, as city folk flee the cities and head to the open spaces and cooler climes of the provinces. During Holy Week, the daily traffic jam is transferred from the cities to the highways going to the resorts. But not this time. The MMDA has warned motorists not to use Edsa during Holy Week as it would surely be clogged with traffic. But dont blame the MMDA for that; blame the Department of Public Works and Highways. The DPWH will undertake an extensive road reblocking project on Edsa. That is the puzzling practice of tearing up the concrete of still good streets, on which motorists see no defects, and then pouring new concrete into the hole. Why the DPWH wastes so much money that can be put to better use elsewhere on this practice puzzles many people. But how else will the contractors earn any money unless the DPWH gives them contracts? And when contractors have no money, how can they spread the joy? Anyway, the MMDA said the DPWH will close Edsa, leaving only one lane open, during Holy Week to do its road reblocking on this busy street. If you are going anywhere north or south of Metro Manila on Holy Week, avoid Edsa; look for alternative routes. Except that the alternative routes would probably be clogged with vehicles avoiding Edsa. You will perhaps think that it would be better to escape to the provinces. Except that the highways would also be jammed with traffic. So the smart thing to do may be to stay home and laze in the garden, hose yourself and the children with water on the lawn, and then cool yourselves with ice cream, halo-halo, or any ice-cold drink. In the late afternoon, when the sun is no longer so hot, go to the nearest church and pray that our officials will grow better brains. As to the infernal traffic jam, everybody at the Kapihan agreed that the problem is that there are too many vehicles in Metro Manila and environs. Every year, the car companies pour 250,000 new vehicles into the country, most of which end up in Metro Manila. That does not include the vehicles smuggled in through the free ports and the jeepneys assembled in Cavite and Laguna from second-hand parts. Where are we going to put all that when the number of streets is not increasing proportionally? You cannot put 10 pounds of sh-t in a five-pound bagits as simple as that. Unlike in other countries, no vehicle is voluntarily phased out in the Philippines. Filipino mechanics and body builders can make the World War II jeep run almost forever. In the Philippines, roads are used not only for travelling but also for parking. Drive around Metro Manila at night and you will see vehicles double-parked on all streets, including those in squatter colonies. In other Asian cities like Tokyo and Singapore, you will not be sold a vehicle unless you can show a title to a garage. In Singapore, downtown is closed to most vehicles. If you have to go there, you have to pay a stiff fee. And in New York, owning a vehicle has become so expensive that New Yorkers have to content themselves to life without a car. But New York, Tokyo and Singapore have efficient mass transport systems which we dont have. And this is where the Light Rail Transit and the Metrorail come in. Their problem is not too few but too many passengers. The train passengers are packed like sardines and the long queues run down to the streets. Passengers line up for an hour or more, much longer than the travelling time on board the trains. In this the LRT is better off than the MRT 3. The former has 140 coaches, double the 70 coaches of the latter. MRT 3 is buying 48 more coaches, but the first batch wont be shipped here until late next year. Until then, we have to grin and bear it.",Neal H.

2014-04-10,,,"Vehicle users, Government agencies","MANILA, Philippines  Nearly 3000 road accidents have been recorded from January to February this year, a record higher than same period last year, Philippine National Police (PNP) said Thursday. Statistics of the Highway Patrol Group (HPG) of the PNP said 217 accidents involving buses and 530 involving trucks has been recorded since January 2014. Superintendent Elizabeth Velasquez of the HPG said leading factors in road accidents were human error and lack of road discipline such as over-speeding, drunk driving, use of cell phone while driving, bad overtaking, bad turning, mechanical defects and poor maintenance. Velasquez said another contributing factor is the lack of knowledge among drivers. She expressed worries that their national statistics revealed that bus accidents involve mostly provincial buses. Nationwide, mostly are provincial buses, she said. She reminded motorists of the importance of checking their vehicles BLOWBAGS or brake, light, oil, water, battery, air, gasoline, and self. According to her, the self is very important when driving. Kung di naman nasa kondisyon yung driver, puyat, medyo galit, doon magkakaroon ng problema sa pagda-drive, she said. (If the driver is not in the right condition, lacks sleep or is agitated, his driving becomes problematic.) Velasquez stressed the importance of safe driving especially this Holy Week where bulk of motorists would be having their vacations. She said road rage is also prevalent this dry season. Tumataas ang road rage dahil mainit ang panahon. Cool lang kayo sa biyahe, she said. According to her, HPG would install police booths along the North Luzon Expressway (NLEx) and the South Luzon Expressway (SLEx) to assist motorists with their concerns.

In a phone interview with The STAR yesterday, LTFRB chairman Winston Ginez said they believe the additional buses will be sufficient in handling the bulk of the passengers who will travel to and from the provinces starting today. The permits will be in effect from today until April 21. Ginez said operators of more than 900 buses have applied for special permits, but many were disapproved for failing to comply with the requirements set by the board. LTFRB spokesperson Mary Ann Salada added that the board has denied the requests of operators who applied more than 25 percent of their authorized vehicles. We dont want them to abandon their routes, she said. Ginez said the board only issued special permits to buses and not other public utility vehicles. He said buses allowed to ply a different route need to put on their windshields the special permits, which are printed on white paper and bear the signature of the three members of the board. Ginez said they have set up help desks at major bus terminals to assist passengers traveling this Lenten season.

2014-04-15,,,,"MANILA, Philippines  To help alleviate the countrys air pollution woes, Senate President Franklin Drilon on Tuesday called on local government units (LGUs) and the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) to move towards making major roads and thoroughfares conducive to bikers and other pedestrians. Drilon said the government programs against air pollution in the countrys metropolitan areas must effectively strike against the main-contributing factor: motorized vehicles. He then cited a Department of Environment and Natural Resources report, which stated that 80% of pollution load is contributed by mobile sources or vehicles. The best way to promote modes of transport that do not rely on gasoline or diesel engines is to make our cities safer and more accessible and favorable to these environment-friendly forms of mobility, the Senate leader said in a statement. Our very roads must inspire and help commuters shift to biking and walking. Given the heavy traffic in the streets of our cities, there is a great potential for bicycles and walking to be the preferred mode of transportation for our countrymen on the go, he added. Drilon noted that such initiatives were not exactly unheard of in the country as he pointed to several road projects in Iloilo where non-motorized travel has been integrated in the road systems. He specifically cited the road-widening project along the 10-kilometer Sen. Benigno Aquino Jr. Avenue in Iloilo, which features a six-lane highway, a pedestrian lane and a five-meter paved bike lane that will extend from the Jaro District in Iloilo City to the Iloilo International Airport. The Senate leader also noted how a 14-km circumferential road connecting Arevalo District in Iloilo City and the coastal road in Dumangas town in Iloilo, have been designed to include a two-meter painted bike lane throughout its entire span. Drilon hopes that similar efforts will be made throughout the entire country as he advised the DPWH and LGUs to study if such initiatives could be made in their localities. We need to explore more options and choose the best alternatives. These programs will not only help alleviate our environmental concerns, but they will also promote a healthier regimen for our people, he said. The Senate leader said he would support any legislation towards such initiatives if congressional backing would prove to be necessary to commence these ideas.",Maila Ager,"2:11 PM | Tuesday, April 15th, 2014",Senator,yes,2014-04-15 00:00:00,"formulation of legislationlocal ordinances,road infrastructure repair,maintenance,alternative transportation,traffic congestion solutions,biking,pedestrianization",,,,,,,,english,,http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/594389/drilon-i-love-bicycles-lets-build-bike-lanes,,"iloilo city, iloilo",text,,277.0,,538.0,,mavie,,,"road infrastructure, policy and legislation, nonmotorized transport, vehicle safety and maintenance, traffic congestion, alternative transportation",6.0,Straight News,,,,,,inquirer,no,,,,,Drilon: I love bicycles; let's build bike lanes | Inquirer News,Neutral,,

2014-04-21,,,,"MONCADA, PhilippinesTravel time from Balintawak in Quezon City to Rosales town in Pangasinan province will now take only a little over two hours with the opening of a section of the Tarlac-Pangasinan-La Union Expressway (TPLEx). This is a very big thing [for travelers heading north], said Mark Dumol, president of Private Infrastructure Development Corp., operator of the expressway and a subsidiary of San Miguel Corp. The TPLEx, which when completed will stretch to Rosario town in La Union province, initially opened a section to Gerona town and later to Paniqui town in Tarlac province last year. At that time, travel time from Barangay (village) Carmen in Rosales to Balintawak via the Subic-Clark-Tarlac Expressway and the North Luzon Expressway (NLEx) took three hours. I think tourism in the north will get a big boost. Our traffic here has been growing very strong, Dumol said. He said tourist destinations north of Rosalessuch as Baguio City, the surfing town of San Juan in La Union and the pilgrimage town of Manaoag in Pangasinanwould now be more accessible. Pangasinan Gov. Amado Espino Jr., who joined the motorcade from Moncada to Victoria town in Tarlac, said the new road would also benefit farmers and traders in Pangasinan. Our products will now reach Metro Manila faster, Espino said. Dumol said the newly opened TPLEx section was connected to Magilas Trail, a road that spans Sta. Maria town to Binalonan town. He said travelers going to Baguio and the Ilocos provinces could bypass the town of Villasis and Urdaneta City by taking Magilas Trail. In Baguio City, the summer capitals tourism industry expects the newly opened TPLEx stretch to bring in more tourists. But they should expect traffic slowdown once they reach the city, said a leader of an organization of local hotels and restaurants. Anthony de Leon, president of the Hotel and Restaurant Association of Baguio, urged city officials to improve traffic plans, given the traffic jams that have been plaguing sections of Baguio since Monday. Traffic flow is also expected to slow down in Villasis, Binalonan, Pozorrubio and Sison and Urdaneta City in Pangasinan because of road-widening projects. Dumol said the TPLEx was expected to be completed by December 2015. But its going to depend a lot on right-of-way acquisition. Im not sure how it will go. Actually, our immediate target is to open up to Urdaneta by December this year. We are acquiring the right-of-way now and we already have 10 out of 12 kilometers [needed], he said. He said the TPLEx section from Paniqui to Rosales would be toll-free for a month. He also assured motorists of the TPLExs safety. He said the TPLEx had four patrol vehicles, four motorcycles and an ambulance. The Taal overpass along the NLEx was closed to heavy vehicles after a section was accidentally smashed by a tower crane on Tuesday, said Rodrigo Franco, president of Manila North Tollways Corp. A bus also hit the crane, injuring four of its passengers. The crane was being ferried by a truck along the northbound lane at around 5 p.m. when it struck the bridge, triggering a two-hour gridlock.",,"1:02 AM | Monday, April 21st, 2014",Private Infrastructure Development Corporation,yes,2014-04-21 00:00:00,"reports on traffic congestion,traffic advisories",,,,,,,,english,,http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/595865/tplex-speeds-up-travel-to-north-but-gridlock-greets-baguio-tourists,,"quezon, san miguel, metro manila, la union, baguio, tarlac, rosario, san juan, quezon city, manila, urdaneta, pangasinan",text,,52.0,,725.0,,mavie,,,traffic congestion,7.5,Straight News,,,,,,inquirer,no,,,,,"TPLEx speeds up travel to North, but gridlock greets Baguio tourists | Inquirer News",Neutral,,
2014-04-21,,,,"The Holy Week may be over, but the publics agony on Edsa is not. The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) served notice to motorists and commuters that the latest reblocking or road repair activities on the 24-kilometer highway would not be completed today due to the inefficiencies of some of the work crews. MMDA Chair Francis Tolentino on Sunday said the agency would demand an explanation from the private contractors tapped by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) for their failure to meet the deadline. Days before the Lenten break, the MMDA made repeated announcements about the schedule of the reblocking projects, asking the public to avoid Edsa. I think the delay is due to the inefficiencies of some contractors. Kung babagal-bagal at tatamad-tamad ay yun talaga ang mangyayari (If they are working slowly and lazily, thats the result), Tolentino said on the MMDAs weekly radio program. The MMDA chief said he would write a letter to the district engineers of the DPWH and the contractors, noting that their competence and efficiency are at stake here. There is no excuse for the delay because the date of the completion of the work is part of the agreement, he said. We have given them time to do the work and still they havent completed them. I think the problem rests with them. One of the areas which would not be finished on time is the section near the gate of Dasmarias Village in Makati City, according to Tolentino. He said the contractor for that section started pouring fresh concrete only on Black Saturday despite being given ample time to do so starting Maundy Thursday. Other delayed repairs were on two sections in Urdaneta Village, near the inner lane of Estrella Street also in Makati. These sections would therefore remain closed to traffic even after todays 5 a.m. deadline, Tolentino said. But the official assured motorists that most of the southbound lanes will be open to vehicles on Monday. Reached for comment, Rey Tagudando, director of the DPWH-National Capital Region office, said the road projects were delayed mainly because the MMDA moved the start of the reblocking schedule by 16 hours, from Tuesday to Wednesday last week. We complied, but we didnt agree that we could compress the work within the given time. We just promised the MMDA that we would give it our best effort, Tagudando said in a phone interview. Earlier, the MMDA decided to delay the reblocking projects on at least 94 sections of Edsa for the sake of travelers leaving the capital for the Holy Week break. Work on the southbound lane of Edsa started at 2 p.m. Wednesday instead of 10 p.m. Tuesday. Most of the (sections for reblocking) are already finished. But we need at least three days for the curing (or drying) period or else the newly repaired roads would easily deteriorate, Tagudando said. Tagudando said the DPWH had asked the MMDA to give them time for the curing period until Tuesday noon. MMDA officials can open the sections that are still in the curing process, but these officials should be held liable if the resulting work is found to be substandard, he said. Our advice to motorists is to avoid Edsa until Tuesday, the public works official said.",Nia P.

Attached to the report filed by SPO3 Manuel Mandapat, team leader on duty of the Presidents motorcycle escorts, were pictures of Roxas Chua, a resident of Urdaneta Village in Makati, and his car, a red Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution (UWI-797). While being issued a ticket for reckless driving and speeding, Roxas Chua allegedly told Mandapat and a traffic enforcer: Kay Presidente pala kayo ha. Ganyan pala.

The President was on his way to the Ninoy Aquino International Airport for inspection when Roxas Chua tried to recklessly overtake a vehicle of the Presidential Communication Operations Office (PCOO).

The traffic jams persisted during the early morning rush hour, inconveniencing workers heading for work as well as vacationers returning from the provinces, radio dZBB reported. Metropolitan Manila Development Authority chairman Francis Tolentino said he may ask for an explanation from some of the contractors involved in the Holy Week reblocking operations. ""Papaliwanagin natin ang contractor na kung bakit sa halip Good Friday gagawin ... nagtrabaho siya sa Black Saturday,"" Tolentino said in an interview on dZBB radio. Citing information reaching him, Tolentino said the contractor was allowed to start reblocking operations Maundy Thursday, so the solution used in the repair work will have time to cure. Yet, he said the workers only got on the job on Saturday. As a result, the concrete was not yet fully cured as of Monday. A separate report by dzBB's Rodil Vega said one area affected by the ""unfinished"" work was the northbound part of EDSA near Guadix in Mandaluyong City.

2014-04-22,,,Government agencies,"(Updated 10:44 a.m., April 23) The row between the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board and the city government of Makati heightened as the LTFRB stood pat on its decision regarding the city's free shuttle service. The LTFRB is requiring the Makati city government to comply with procedures and apply for a special permit to continue offering its free shuttle service from the MRT North Avenue station, which is in Quezon City, to Ayala Avenue in Makati as a public service to commuters. The agency sent a letter signed by LTFRB board member Engr. Ronald Corpus to Makati Mayor Jejomar Binay Jr. asking the latter to for the shuttle service to continue for an extended period. However, the Makati city government reiterated that according to Local Government Code, it has the power to provide adequate transportation services. It also said it should not be required to get Certificates of Public Convenience following the Public Service Act as amended. The LTFRB meanwhile, replied and said it did not require a CPC from Makati City, but that the agency has jurisdiction over public land transportation services even if these are operated by government entities. The Board commends the City Government of Makatis initiative to provide free shuttle service, and its willingness to coordinate with the Board in pursuit of offering public service to the people, LTFRB chairman Atty. Winston Ginez said. However, the LTFRB Board said the shuttle vehicles would be operating a public utility or common carrier service which falls under the regulatory powers of LTFRB. The directive of the Board for the City of Makati to file an application/petition for a special permit is but an exercise of our regulatory authority. We enjoined the City of Makati to abide with our existing laws on public land transportation similar to the strict implementation of rules and ordinances in their jurisdiction, Ginez said. Ginez made the assurance that the Board will act promptly on Makati City's application for special permit as soon as the required documentary requirements are submitted. We share the City of Makatis aim of helping public commuters efficiently and conveniently reach their destinations but the public transport mode should be within the bounds of the Public Service Law, Ginez said. Since March 27, the Makati City government has deployed buses to provide free shuttle services to commuters coming from North EDSA in Quezon City who work in Makati City. It said the service, which runs from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. Mondays to Fridays, seeks to benefit commuters affected by the MRT's recent problems and ongoing infrastructure projects in Metro Manila. Also, it said the program aims ""to help alleviate the expected impact of the simultaneous implementation of major road infrastructure projects of the government along EDSA and other major thoroughfares."" We intend to continue offering free shuttle services to Makati workers, especially since traffic along EDSA is expected to get worse because of simultaneous major road infrastructure projects, .

This was reported on Monday by Public Works Secretary Rogelio Singson who assured the public that the rehabilitation of the remaining sections would be completed before the end of summer. Earlier, DPWH-National Capital Region director Reynaldo Tagudando told the Inquirer that they would likely finish the reblocking project by April 28. The agency earlier identified 85,051-sq-m of road space on Edsa that needed immediate repairs. Tagudando later disclosed that private contractors hired by the DPWH to do the job had finished working on 57,418-sq-m and that they would complete the rest during Holy Week. In a briefing with reporters on Monday, Singson also said that they were taking full responsibility for the slight delay in the reopening of portions of the 23-kilometer highway that were closed to traffic due to last weeks reblocking activities. The DPWH, he stressed, would not engage in a blame game with the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) which earlier said it would ask some of the project contractors to explain why they failed to meet the deadline. Portions of the countrys busiest thoroughfare opened at 8 a.m. Monday, instead of 5 a.m. as the DPWH had announced. Tagudando, on the other hand, attributed the delay to the MMDAs decision to delay the start of the concrete reblocking by 16 hours last week. At the same time, Singson said the agency would push for the implementation of the much-delayed P3.74 billion major rehabilitation of Edsa at least from Roxas Boulevard to the Greenhills area.

From Skyway going to the CBD, exit at Don Bosco off-ramp and take Don Bosco Street, then Chino Roces to destination; or continue driving northward along Osmea, turn right at Dela Rosa Street and cross Chino Roces toward Ayala area; or go straight along Osmea, cross Buendia and turn right to Malugay toward Ayala Avenue. If coming from South Luzon Expressway (SLEx), private motorists may also take the C-5/ Kalayaan Avenue route. For southbound light private vehicles: If going to the CBD from Osmea, turn left at Zobel Roxas, right to Kamagong, and right to Ayala Avenue Extension. Motorists may also pass through Osmea and turn left to Malugay or Buendia to destination. To bypass the work site between P. Ocampo and Buendia, motorists may turn right to P. Ocampo, left at Filmore or Dian or Bautista, head south, cross Buendia, then turn left to Edison, left again at Arnaiz and turn right to Osmea toward the destination. Trucks and buses traversing Osmea must use the Osmea-Buendia Flyover. Vehicles with a gross weight exceeding 4,500 kilos are prohibited from using other roads within Makati, such as the secondary roads, as alternate routes. Light private vehicles may, however, use the roads assigned for buses and trucks. Northbound buses and trucks using Skyway are not allowed to go beyond the Magallanes Exit. They must exit at the Skyway Magallanes off-ramp and take Osmea ground level and the Buendia-Osmea Flyover, then proceed northward along Osmea to destination. Buses bound for LRT Taft-Buendia station will be provided with a U-turn slot along Osmea near the Makati-Manila boundary at Zobel Roxas area. This will serve as a turn-around point to allow buses to take Buendia toward Taft Avenue. Buses from Taft-Buendia going south via SLEx and Skyway must take Buendia, turn right to Edison, turn left to Rockefeller or Arnaiz and exit to Osmea toward the destination. Southbound buses and trucks from Manila area traveling along Osmea must use the Osmea-Buendia Flyover.",,"12:13 AM | Thursday, April 24th, 2014",Makati City government,yes,2014-04-24 00:00:00,traffic advisories,,,,,,,,english,,http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/596917/makati-readies-12-month-traffic-plan-for-skyway-3,,"makati, manila, roxas",text,,345.0,,90.0,,candice,,,traffic congestion,5.5,Straight News,,,,,,inquirer,no,no,,,,Makati readies 12-month traffic plan for Skyway 3 | Inquirer News,Neutral,,
2014-04-25,,,,"MANILA, Philippines - The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) suspended yesterday the operations of two accredited tow truck companies following complaints of recklessness resulting in damage to property and abuse of authority. BNW Towing Services was suspended for three months after Jayross Lucky Seven Tours Bus Co. Inc. filed a complaint for reckless imprudence. MMDA chairman Francis Tolentino said a Jayross Lucky Seven tour bus (UVF-927) stalled along Kamias Road in Quezon City due to engine failure. The bus was immediately clamped and towed away by a truck of the BNW Towing Services. While being towed, the MMDA said the tow truck driver miscalculated the clearance of the Kamias flyover, causing the roof of the bus to hit the underside of the interchange. The insurance company of Jayross refused to pay for the damage. After a series of hearings, MMDA ruled in favor of the complainant, resulting in the suspension. We will never tolerate any acts of abuse from all the accredited tow truck companies. We are constantly monitoring their operations for the protection of the public, Tolentino said. Another firm, Haplos Towing Services, was also suspended for one month for abuse of authority over the complaint lodged with the MMDA by a truck operator from Valenzuela City. Complainant Marissa Paz alleged that her Toyota Dyna truck (WPH-307) was forcibly towed by Haplos Towing Services using a seatbelt instead of a tow bar after it stalled. Tolentino said Haplos Towing Services had failed to follow the proper towing procedures stated under the MMDA guidelines on towing. All the tow trucks of these companies are restricted within the confines of their garage facilities during the period covered by the suspension orders, Tolentino said.",,"By Mike Frialde, The Philippine Star",Metropolitan Manila Development Authority,yes,2014-04-25 00:00:00,enforcement of existing lawsordinances,,,,,,,,english,,http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/04/24/14/mmda-suspends-2-towing-firms,,"valenzuela, quezon city, quezon, manila",text,,374.0,,1209.0,,candice,,,traffic enforcement and violations,5.5,Straight News,,,,,,abs-cbnnews,no,no,,,,MMDA suspends 2 towing firms,Neutral,,

MMDA Chair Francis Tolentino identified the two as AKH Contractor and Jargon Builders. Tolentino said the two contractors would each be penalized P25,000 for not complying with the road rehabilitation schedule agreed upon by his agency and DPWH. I have written the two contractors a letter asking them to explain why they were not able to complete the project on time, he added. He also asked the district engineer of the DPWH to explain the delay in the concrete reblocking project. Tolentino, however, was quick to pin the blame on the inefficiency of the contractor and the DPWH district engineer, particularly in the affected area near Dasmarias Village in Makati City. This was contrary to the opinion of Reynaldo Tagudando, director of the DPWH in Metro Manila, who blamed the MMDA for the delay, saying had the agency not pushed back the start of the road repair work by 16 hours, their contractors would have finished on time. Although the DPWH and MMDA both agreed to finish the concrete reblocking of Edsa during Holy Week, they failed to meet their target. There are still 2,000 square meters of road space in Mandaluyong and Quezon City which need to be rehabilitated.

2014-04-26,,,"Public officials, Government agencies","In 1789, as hundreds of thousands starved in France because of a bread shortage, Marie Antoinette, King Louis XVIs consort, supposedly said: They have no bread? Let them eat cake. Early this month, as hundreds of thousands of Filipino commuters went through the daily ordeal of queuing for up to an hour to ride the packed MRT trains because they have no cars and because buses are more expensive and slower, President Aquinos spokesperson said something like: They cant ride the trains? Let them discover other options, like the bus or something. That the Presidents alter ego could say that explains why our public transport system is sopardon my Frenchf-cked up. Like Marie Antoinette, the chauffeured classes who run and operate our trains and our country are more out of touch and more out of it than ever. Indeed, perhaps nothing more visibly illustrates this than those incredibly long lines snaking out from MRT stations: a direct consequence of our elites reluctance to invest in additional trains that can serve millions, while railroading projects that allow a few thousand of them to fly from their gated enclaves in Alabang or Nasugbu to their gated enclaves in Makati. One can tell how a countrys rulers treat the common folk just by looking at the trains. Their lack of compassion shows in the details: in those ridiculously narrow passages under the Guadalupe and Kamuning stations that force hundreds of people to walk sideways just inches away from rampaging buses; in the escalators and elevators that rarely work, endangering the pregnant and shutting out the handicapped and the elderly; in that inexplicable kilometer-long gap between the Roosevelt LRT station and the North Edsa MRT station that forces passengers to trudge down several flights of stairs, jump into another jeep, go through two shopping malls, then climb several flights of stairs again, only to be packed into the trains like chickens headed to the abattoir. Perhaps nothing more clearly exemplifies the combination of cold indifference and crass opportunism with which our elites treat us than the way they designed the connection between the Cubao MRT and LRT stations: Instead of being built as close to each other as possible, these are built so as to force passengers to march for another kilometer through a shopping mall, thus enabling its owners to jack up their tenants rent. Arent these a form of cruel and unusual punishment, a form of avoidable suffering? Dont these constitute mass violencenow such a routine that we dont even think of it as violence? Some say these are just engineering or management issues that cant be blamed on our chauffeured classes. But decisions involving public transportfrom how much to spend for trains vis--vis skyways to how wide walkways should berequire the approval of our officials and their private partners, as well as the tacit acceptance of all the other elites who can potentially object. And so far, there is no indication that our elitesnormally split on other issuesare bitterly divided over the overfunding of projects that disproportionately favor them. Nor do theyor the parties, nongovernment organizations and intellectuals they patronizeseem particularly troubled by the massive underfunding of public services. Besides, if they cant be bothered to review the blueprints to ensure that our elderly wont be trampled on the platforms or that our kids wont be run over by buses on the ground-level passages, then what does that say about how our elites treat us? Engineering or management questions are always political questions: They are struggles about who gains and who suffers. And it is in such mundane things as the architecture of public infrastructure, in the landscape of our cities, that the outcomes of these battles are reflected and cemented. Today, that struggle remains dominated by our chauffeured classes, and it is ultimately this contingent balance of social forcesnot their innate lack of compassion or their lack of good ideasthat explains why our public transport system is so violent. For if our elites dont care about our people, it is not because they are incapable of caring. It is because they have gotten away with caring about other things: not the meeting of our peoples needs, but the inflation of their land values, stocks, or tongpats. But if they have so far gotten away, it is only because so far no countervailing group has forced them to change their priorities. After all, if the train lines of Paris, San Francisco and other cities are more humane, it is only because the commuting classes of those cities fought for themthrough civil disobedience, campaigns, strikes, protests, direct actionsagainst the bitter opposition of their own chauffeured classes. One can tell how scared a countrys rulers are of its people just by looking at the trains they build for them. And our rulers wont be cowed to care unless all that rage pent up inside every MRT commuter is channeled toward a social movement that can defend us from our elites violence and advance concrete alternatives for a different kind of public transport system, a different kind of city, a different kind of development. For now, much of the rage that can fuel such a movement remains dispersed. But, as shown by peoples prompt reactions to the governments Marie-Antoinette-like provocation, that may be changing. They discovered other options: Batmobiles, Star Trek transporters, magic carpetsor flying on the wings of love Perhaps thats also how the French started in the 1780s: by trading jokes. But, as we know from what happened to Marie Antoinette and the aristocracy, the French didnt stop at joking.

2014-10-03,,,,"MANILA - Two Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) traffic enforcers lodged complaints against a drunk lawyer for allegedly assaulting them when they responded to a traffic altercation along EDSA before midnight Tuesday. According to a report by the police station in Eastwood, Quezon City, lawyer Bettina Zamora, 30, a resident of Corinthian Gardens, was driving her black BMW sedan (ZLJ-468) along EDSAs northbound lane near Ortigas Avenue when she reportedly had a heated argument with another motorist at around 11:43 p.m. Tuesday. Zamora is a senior associate at the Kapunan, Garcia and Castillo Law Offices. The law firm formerly represented businesswoman Janet Lim Napoles in the illegal detention case lodged against her by her cousin Benhur Luy before the Makati regional trial court. MMDA enforcers Saturnino Embuscado and Michael Arcilla arrived at the scene to investigate the commotion, which was causing traffic to slow down, the police report stated. Zamora hurled invectives at the enforcers, who radioed for police assistance. Four police officers, led by Senior Police Officer 2 Ritchie Madrid, arrived and brought her to the Eastwood police station. In his sworn affidavit, Embuscado said while asking Zamora what the commotion all about, the lawyer reportedly started to shout expletives at him. Embuscado said Zamora then grabbed his neck and pushed him away after he asked her if she had been drinking. Embuscado and Arcilla then sought police assistance after Zamora allegedly tried to drive away. Madrid, on the other hand, said Zamora gave him the dirty finger while shouting expletives in Filipino. Madrid said Zamora then grabbed his neck and uniform, adding that the lawyer pulled at his uniform so hard that it was torn. Madrid said he then handcuffed Zamora and arrested her. Zamora tested positive for alcohol following a breath test at the Jose Reyes Memorial Medical Center in Manila. According to the police report, complaints for direct assault, obstruction, alarm and scandal, and driving under the influence of liquor (Republic Act 10586) were filed against Zamora with the Quezon City prosecutors office. MMDA Chairman Francis Tolentino said he will recommend to the Land Transportation Office that Zamoras license to drive be revoked.

2014-05-01,,,,"The daily travails on the road experienced by workers in the business process outsourcing (BPO) industry, a sector that has swelled the number of late-night or predawn commuters in the metropolis, have led to a new initiative against abusive or criminal-minded drivers. The Text for Safety project of the BPO Workers Association of the Philippines (BWAP) has opened a complaints hotline to help ensure that such drivers are caught and penalized. Launched on the eve of Labor Day, the project is in partnership with the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) and technology provider Eacomm Corp. The purpose of Text for Safety is to assist workers traveling at night. There have been cases of call center agents becoming victims of robbery and sexual abuse. They often fall asleep while commuting because of fatigue, so we need to safeguard their welfare, said BWAP president Ruben Torres, a former labor secretary. If you travel at precarious hours, you can text (the information about the driver and vehicle) to 0927-2927933. (The information) will be stored in a databank. If something happens to you, the BWAP will forward the information to LTFRB for immediate action and coordination with government agencies, Torres added. If the driver is discourteous, if the bus is out of line or if the taxi driver is overcharging, send us the complaint and we will attend to the problem, he added. Marcelo Robosa, Eacomm chair and BWAP director for education, said that after sending the information, the complainant will get a confirmation text. BWAP could provide legal assistance for cases that would reach the courts, Robosa said. Torres said that while BWAPs primary concern is the safety of the more than 800,000 BPO workers nationwide, the service is available to all who regularly travel to work using public utility vehicles (PUVs) regulated by the LTFRB. We are mandated to ensure the convenience and safety of the people when they travel in the metropolis, hence this agreement is very timely and highly relevant to our road safety campaign, LTFRB chair Winston Ginez said. Eacomm will provide technical support for the project and will also offer Trip Barker, a phone application that provides route information around the Metro and allows users to share traffic and weather reports.

2014-05-01,,,,"MANILA - The initial batch of new plates arrived at the Land Transportation Office (LTO) central main office on Thursday. As of now, 20,000 motor vehicle plates and almost 10,000 motorcycle plates are housed inside the LTO warehouse. The plates are currently being distributed to regional district offices. Metro cities are prioritized. By next week, these new plates will be seen on the road. New motor vehicles registered February 17 onwards and new motorcycles registered last September 2013 onwards will get the new batch of plates. For existing vehicles, they can avail of the new plates for P450 upon renewal of registration. The LTO is targeting June this year to finish all the backlog on the license plates registration and car stickers. Last month, LTO Assistant Secretary Alfonso Tan admitted that the backlog started in 2012 when the winning bidder failed to produce the license plates and car registration stickers. As of 2013, the backlog on motor vehicle plates is around 400,000 and 1 million for LTO stickers. The release of new plates was expected late April this year. LTO spokesperson Jason Salvador explained there has been a slight delay due to the Holy Week vacation. The original release of the new plates was scheduled September last year, but delayed due to issues on the release of funds by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) for the project. The standardized plates will eventually replace the nine different designs currently in use since 1981. By 2016, all vehicles will be sporting the new look. Private motor vehicle plates will have black-and-white design, while public vehicles will retain the black-and-yellow scheme. These new license plates are patterned after those in Europe. License plates for cars and other private vehicles will now have 3 control letters and 4 digits such as ABC-1234, while motorcycle plates will have 2 control letters and 5 digits such as AB-12345. Plates for public utility vehicles (PUVs) will have 3 control letters and 4 digits plus their route. The new plates will be loaded with security features to make it easier for law enforcement agencies to rid roads of colorum vehicles.

2014-05-04,,,,"BE water, my friend. The immortal words of Bruce Lee come to mind as I pedal my way through the daily chaos of the city streets. As I claim my space on the road, jeepneys cut me off to unload or pick up passengers, taxis routinely swerve into my path angling for fares, pedestrians cross heedlessly, pretending they dont see me. Behind me a bus honks its air horns loudly, trying to dislodge me from my path. All of this is going on simultaneously. I hear Bruce whisper softly in my ear: Be like water making its way through cracks. Do not be assertive, but adjust to the object, and you shall find a way around or through it. If nothing within you stays rigid, outward things will disclose themselves. Indeed, there is a flow even in this apparent chaos, and if you can perceive it with an open mind, you can move through the streets unharmed. Riding a bicycle in Metro Manila is not a form of transport, or exercise, or recreation. It is more akin to a martial art, because PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO KILL YOU, and it will take all your skill, stamina, a Zen-like state of preternatural awareness and a warriors indomitable spirit to make it to your destination in one piece. Okay, maybe people arent really trying to kill you, not intentionally anyway, but make no mistake: to ride a bicycle in the city is to take your life in your own hands, so youd better know what youre doing. Consider this: Traffic is gridlocked, buses are rolling death-traps and the lines for the MRT are longer than the actual trip youre taking. Gas prices keep rising, air quality is falling and merely getting from one place to another is a huge pain in the ass. Despite all that, people are starting to take a serious look at the bicycle as an alternative means of transportation. With more and more city dwellers taking up cycling as a form of recreation, and experiencing the bicycles energy efficiency first-hand, the idea of applying it to a more utilitarian purpose, i.e., getting to work, or to the mall, or to do the marketing, becomes more and more appealing. In recent months, the Share the Road Movement, a grassroots movement of cyclists and environmentalists, has begun to lobby the government for a more equitable distribution of road space through the creation of bicycle lanes and walkways so citizens could be less in thrall to motorized transport. The idea is, if there are dedicated bicycle lanes, more people would be encouraged to ride these two-wheelers instead of bringing cars or taking public transport, thereby reducing traffic and pollution, and creating a more physically fit population. Certain cities such as Marikina already have a system of bicycle lanes, and recently the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) converted a couple of sidewalks along EDSA into bicycle lanes, complete with a bike sharing scheme. A utopian pipe dream or a sensible alternative? To find out, I decide to conduct a one-day experiment. Within the day, I will use a bicycle to get to work, go to the mall, and carry my stuff home. The first hurdle: the bicycle. You may not need bicycle lanes to get to your destination, but you do need a bicycle. Ideally, a dedicated commuter bicycle, with provisions for locking it up, lighting for nighttime riding, some provisions for carrying stuff like racks and bags, maybe fenders for rain and a tool kit for on the road repairs. In a pinch, though, any bicycle will do: a mountain bike, a folder, a road racer, even a cheap surplus mama-chari (moms bike, a Japanese housewifes errand bike). Again, Bruce Lee provides some wisdom: Adapt what is useful, reject what is useless, and add what is specifically your own. Im a bit of a bike nut, and I have several, but I choose an old fixed-gear bike for several reasons: its easier to navigate city streets because I can regulate speed with my legs and my commute is relatively flat; there are fewer things to break down, and its not as attractive to thieves because it has fewer flashy partsa consideration if youre going to be locking it out of sight. For portage, I carry a large shoulder bag. It contains my work clothes and toiletries; a spare tire, pump and a few essential tools; a flasher in case it gets dark on the road, and two locksa sturdy U-lock and a cable lock for good measure. Theres enough space left in the bag in case I need to haul some groceries home. Oh, and I wear a helmet. I live in Quezon City, less than 14 kilometers away from the PDI offices in Makati. With traffic it used to take me an hour to an hour and a half by car to get there, up to three hours a day of commuting time. When I gave up my car and bought a scooter, I immediately cut travel time by half. Will it take any longer by pedal power? The second hurdle: the road. In my experience, the biggest obstacle to cycling is the mental block that keeps riders from heading out on the road. There is an inner voice, quite possibly a childhood memory of a parental warning when you were riding your red tricycle: dont go out into the street! Once more, Bruce to the rescue: If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, youll never get it done. You need to have a mindset of a cyclist, and that is born out of self-confidence that only comes from experience. You have to ride, in order to ride. The shortest route from my home to work takes me through Shaw Boulevard, six lanes of utter chaos with dozens of intersections and few traffic lights, no bicycle lanes, cars and pedestrians crossing willy-nilly. Its a daunting obstacle course, and certainly not one Id recommend for a newbie cyclist. But I see cyclists traversing Shaw everyday, hardcore bike commuters whove learned how to safely navigate the route through experience. Ive been cycling for over three decades, plenty of time to observe how motorists and pedestrians behave on the road, and have pretty well-defined ideas on how to traverse traffic safely. Possibly the most useful advice Ive received on how to ride a bicycle safely on the road came from Effective Cycling, a book published in 1977 by bicycle advocate and activist John Forester, which is still in print. Forester remains a somewhat controversial figure in the alternative transportation world because he has argued consistently against bicycle lanes. Instead he advocates what he calls vehicular cycling. His maxim is, cyclists fare best when they act and are treated as drivers of vehicles. In a nutshell, it means behaving on the road as if you were driving a car: riding a straight line, making left turns from the left lane, avoiding passing on the right. The idea is that motorists are familiar with how other motorists behave in traffic, and react accordingly. If a rider follows the same rules, he reduces the risk of mishaps. Forester also advises cyclists to take control of their lanes when appropriate, so that motorists are not tempted to squeeze into their space but instead pass them with an appropriate margin of safety. Of course, this is an oversimplification. Forester formulated his ideas while riding in England, and adapted them to the US. Allowances have to be made for cultural differences. Pinoy motorists routinely ignore traffic rules, and a cyclist has to anticipate how a motorist will behave. Applying Foresters rules also assume that the cyclist is strong enough to ride at a brisk pace, with enough reserves to move quickly out of harms way when required. But over time, traffic behavior falls into predictable patterns, and cyclists learn how to adapt accordingly to leave an ample margin of safety. Ive learned to navigate the seeming chaos of Shaw Boulevard, adjusting my speed from a comfortable cruise to a relatively fast clip to keep up with the average speed of the traffic. It takes me well under an hour to get to the office, just a little longer than going by scooter, and considerably faster than going by car. Which brings us to the next hurdle: infrastructure. The Inquirer is a relatively bike-friendly workplace. There is secure parking for employees bicycles, and shower facilities that allow you to change from your sweaty, smelly cycling gear into appropriate office attire. This goes a long way toward encouraging more employees to bike to work. Not all workplaces are as friendly, and cycling advocates need to increase the awareness not just of local governments, but private sector employers, not to mention retail outlets, so that secure bicycle parking facilities are incorporated into their infrastructure. Having worked up an appetite from all that mileage, I head home from work, intending to make a stop at a mall for a bite and a bit of shopping. Big shock: Not all malls have appropriate parking facilities for bicycles. In fact, the social networks were recently set abuzz when a popular blogger, who cycled to a well-known restaurant for lunch, locked his bicycle outside. Security guards actually handcuffed his bicycle, sending him into an apoplectic fit and a barrage of enraged missives to the social networks from his iPad. Cycling for transport is still in its infancy in this country, proof of which is the attitude still prevalent among retailers (and their security staff) that bicycles are a nuisance and an eyesore, rather than a boon to their trade. In any case, over the years Ive learned which malls have good bike parking and which dont. I routinely choose one that has fixed bicycle racks close to the guarded parking area, where I can lock my bike. Even then, I heed the advice of the Mullah Nasrudin: trust Allah, but tie your camel first. I lock my bike to a fixed steel bicycle rack with a sturdy U-lock. For good measure, I also use a cable lock to secure the wheels, even though there are roaming security guards in the area. Better safe than sorry, and Ive heard enough horror stories from cyclists who have had their bikes stolen even from seemingly secure parking areas. Having refueled my engine, I head home after a bit of shopping. I buy just enough that I can comfortably carry in my shoulder bag. I could have done the marketing for several days if I had a bike suitably set up to carry loads, and I know quite a few cyclists who do this. But part of the bicycles appeal is its convenienceyou can zip to the store, buy what you need, and zip back home. Not every trip needs to be an expedition. With the sun going down, I clip a red blinker to my seat, and a white one to the handlebar. On a bicycle, it is critical that other road users see you, hence the need for lights. When I get home, I tally the days results: On the minus side well, I could have been flattened by a jeep. Most motorists still have the attitude that the roads belong to them. We have, unfortunately, adopted the American car-centric view that bicyles are for sports or leisure, not daily transport, and cyclists are still treated as third-class citizens on the road (after motorcyclists). Its going to take a major attitude shift among motorists before they agree to share the road with cyclists, and its going to take a while before critical mass is reached. In the meantime, its up to cyclists to do the road-sharing, i.e., to get out there and claim their rightful space. On the plus side, I got to work and back in one piece, with a minimum of expenditure. And I managed to do my cardio, and the days shopping, in the process. I did not experience a single moment of road rage, because I was not trapped helplessly in a metal box immobile in gridlock. On the contrary, there were several moments of pure exhilaration as I zipped effortlessly through gaps in the traffic, powered only by my own legs, my blood pumping endorphins to my brain for a natural high. There were also a few moments of smug self satisfaction as I watched the poor souls stuck in traffic, or waiting helplessly on the sidewalk as packed jeepneys passed them by, or saw the look of abject fear in bus passengers eyes as they careened through EDSA.

2014-05-05,,,,"MANILA, Philippines  Aside from the P3.74-billion major rehabilitation of the 23-kilometer Efipanio de los Santos Avenue, or Edsa, and the construction of the P3.03-billion Edsa-Taft Avenue flyover, five other Metro Manila road projects of the Department of Public Works and Highways are expected to test further the patience of motorists and commuters in Metro Manila when they finally get the go-ahead of Malacaang and the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA). The infrastructure projects are worth at least P8.21 billion, according to a DPWH report, a copy of which was obtained by the Philippine Daily Inquirer. The agency named the planned infrastructure projects as Phase 1 of the P1.7-billion Liwasang Bonifacio-Sta. Monica bridge and the P700-million Gov. Forbes-Espana Street underpass, both in Manila; P1.5-billion widening of the C-5-Bagong Ilog flyover in Pasig City; P793-million Sen. Gil Puyat Ave.-Makati Ave.-Pase de Roxas vehicle underpass in Makati City; and P481-million widening of Gen. Luis Street in Novaliches, Quezon City. The department said that it shall be consulting and securing the necessary approvals prior to project implementation of various agencies, including the Office of the President and the MMDA, which has the final say in the issuance of permits to road projects in Metro Manila. The DPWH noted that as early as last year, it had completed the Detailed Engineering Designs, or DEDs of the five projects, as well as the Edsa major rehabilitation and EDSA-Taft Ave. flyover projects. The DEDs of at least two projects  Edsa rehabilitation and the Liwasang Bonifacio-Sta. Monica bridge  had been finished as early as April 2013. The rest were completed between May and December last year. Last month, Reynaldo Tagudando, director of the DPWH office in the National Capital Region, said they would push for the much-delayed major rehabilitation of Edsa after the P230-million concrete reblocking of about 80,000 square meters of road space in the busiest thoroughfare in the metropolis. He asserted that asphalt overlay is the next best thing to the weekend concrete reblocking and piecemeal repairs on Edsa. After the ongoing reblocking of Edsa, Tagudando said that the roads quality is expected to improve to a 6 or 7. That is, on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the highest. Public Works and Highways Secretary Rogelio Singson earlier said that transforming Edsa into a road as smooth as the North Luzon and South Luzon Expressways could be achieved in one or two years. He pointed out that the highways deterioration over the decades showed that our road standards have really gone downWe are settling for roads full of potholes. The DPWH head also stressed the need to complete the improvements on Edsa, noting that the thoroughfare, which was completed in 1954 (and previously named Highway 54) had practically been neglected by previous administrations. Only piecemeal repairs are being done there. Yet, we can equal that of both NLEx and SLEx, he asserted. With a 2014 budget allocation of more than P130 billion, the DPWH also plans to rehabilitate the last 15,872 kilometers of gravel and unpaved arterial roads nationwide. The amount is 67.7 percent of the agencys total infrastructure program fund of P190.91 billion. The remaining P61.5 billion in capital outlays will go to major flood-control and other infrastructure projects in Metro Manila and the rest of the country. This years budget for the rehabilitation of national roads and bridges is P28.48 billion more than last years, which amounted to P110.93 billion. In another report, Singson disclosed that asset preservation on national roads shall be done with priority on rehabilitation over preventive maintenance, as well as widening of critical intersections and junctions and paving of shoulders to improve road safety. To ensure a longer life span of road pavements, there is a need to implement better drainage on primary roads, he said. Likewise, climate change adaptation initiatives, such as slope protection works and road and bridges designed to cope with higher rainfall and rising sea levels, shall be prioritized. On national bridges, Singson said public investments shall focus on major maintenance works and replacement of those that can can no longer be rehabilitated to improve their overall conditions, as well as the replacement of timber and bailey bridges with concrete or steel structures.

2014-05-06,,,,"Land transportation officials will start on Wednesday a dry run of an articulated bus system that will complement the Metro Rail Transit along Epifanio delos Santos Avenue (EDSA). The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) and the Land Transportation Office (LTO) will hold the dry run from the MRT North Avenue in Quezon City to Taft Avenue in Pasay City. the LTFRB said the initiative has been coordinated with the Department of Transportation and Communications and the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority. Wednesday's dry run will involve one articulated bus for MRT southbound passengers. The LTFRB said the dry run will determine if the articulated bus could be a ""safe and efficient alternative mode of transportation"" along EDSA. LTFRB Chairman Winston Ginez said that if the system is successful, it could be a temporary solution to the crowding at the MRT, at least until new trains can be acquired. The dry run will start Wednesday morning from the MRT North EDSA station. The bus will pass through the EDSA underpass and overpass and stop at Buendia, Ayala and Taft Avenue stations. It will then take its turn at the SM Mall of Asia rotunda and end near the Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 2. Wednesday's start of the dry run coincides with the start of an experimental run of MRT express trains, which also aim to ease the crowding of the MRT.

2014-05-06,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesSnail-paced vehicular traffic along a major thoroughfare in Quezon City was all it took for armed car thieves to commandeer a van from a 30-year-old motorist on Monday night. Jamel Macadaag of Barangay (village) Commonwealth was navigating his white Toyota Hi-Ace van (POB-139) along Mindanao Avenue through slow-moving traffic near Alley 15 in Barangay Bagong Pag-asa when the bandits took the vehicle from him. According to a report from the Quezon City Police Districts Masambong station, the incident happened shortly past 6 p.m. on Monday. Masambong police station commander Superintendent Pedro Sanchez said that with traffic hardly moving because of a bottleneck in the area, a man approached Macadaags vehicle and suddenly opened the passenger side door. To Macadaags surprise the man got on the passenger seat and brandished a .38-caliber revolver, poking his nape with the muzzle. Sanchez said that another man opened the door on the drivers side and grabbed the steering wheel. Fearing for his life, the driver jumped out of the van and ran to nearby establishment to seek help from security guards. But by the time he was able to get help, vehicular traffic had become unsnarled and had started moving, and the car thieves completed their escape in the stolen van. According to Sanchez, Masambong station operatives conducted follow-up operations to locate the stolen vehicle in nearby areas but there was neither a sign of the van nor of the bandits. The case was turned over to the QCPD anti-car theft unit for further investigation and follow-up operations. RELATED STORIES",Jeannette I.

Motoring journalist James Deakin, who hosted Swifts stunt show, has started a petition to lobby the swift passage of the bill. Its been done in the United Kingdom since 1987 and its also been mandatory in many countries like Singapore. Its nothing new, Deakin said. Its just one of these things [that have] been happening. And theres already an established technology. So why cant we put it in our buses? he added. After Swifts show, the precision driver announced his support for Deakins petition. Anything I can do to support the campaign, I will do it. I wish everyone would sign it. Driving a bus is a massive responsibility, Swift said. So many get killed by speeding buses, its unacceptable, something has to be done, he added. Among the recent deadliest crashes due to speeding buses include the Don Mariano Transit bus that fell off the Skyway in Paraaque city and crashed onto a van below last December 2013, killing 20 of the bus passengers, including the driver. The bus was said to be speeding even though the road was wet with rain. The latest case was the bus crash in Mountain Province involving a Florida bus just in February, when the bus lost control of its brakes and fell off a ravine, killing 14 of its passengers, including famous comedian Arvin Tado Jimenez. Also a noted example is the accident involving a Guiding Star bus back in May 2011, when the speeding bus rammed into a taxi in front of UP Ayala Technohub along Commonwealth Avenue in Quezon City. The passenger of the taxi who was killed was Lourdes Chit Estella-Simbulan, a former Philippine Daily Inquirer editor and one of the founders of the independent group Vera Files. For Deakin and Swift, all these crashes can be prevented in the future with the proposed measure. But isnt it ironic that Russ Swift  known for his daredevil parking maneuvers and precision driving  supports such a measure? I would think that anybody would like to emulate what I do in a public place. But I learned my skills in driving areas where no one can get hurt, Swift said. Its just far safer than its out on the public roads in the Philippines, because Ive seen how fast these buses go, he added. In the end, whats more important are the lives that would be saved through this measure, Swift said. Lives are very, very precious, and everything we can do to save lives is good, he added.

2014-10-29,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesPolice on Tuesday traced the license plate registration of a silver Innova, which figured in a road rage incident victimizing the family of a University of the Philippines (UP) professor in Quezon City, to a Priscilla Francisco Meneses of Bambang, Bulacan, but have yet to verify if she is related to Mayor Patrick Meneses of Bulacan town. The professor complained that a male passenger of the Innova had pulled out a gun on her and her family while they were aboard their Fortuner during a traffic altercation on Congressional Avenue Extension in Barangay Pasong Tamo, Quezon City, around noon on Monday. The Innova was apparently in the convoy of a white Land Cruiser, which had swerved too close to and had overtaken the Fortuner twice on the road. The family believes that the gun-toting man who alighted from the Innova was the security escort of the passengers of the Land Cruiser. Records from the Land Transportation Office (LTO) confirmed that the Innovas license plate No. ZEL-124 was registered to Meneses and the Land Cruisers plate PQS-904 to Mactan Construction Supply in San Juan City, the Quezon City Police District (QCPD) said. In an interview, QCPD director Senior Supt. Joel Pagdilao said investigators had not yet identified any suspects, but they were already directed to check on the addresses in the sport utility vehicles registration records to confirm the identity of the owners and those who were actually involved in Mondays incident. It is possible other people were using the cars, Pagdilao said. Part of the verification is whether Meneses is the mother of the Bulacan town mayor and Meneses link to Mactan Construction Supply, he added. On Tuesday, the Inquirer tried but failed to reach Mayor Meneses. He was out of his office and did not take calls made or replied to text messages sent to his mobile phone. Joey Rodrigo, tourism and information officer of the Bulacan municipal government, could not say where the mayor was. He said he was not sure if Meneses was attending a meeting of the League of Municipalities of the Philippines chapter in Bulacan (LMP) or was out of the province for another engagement. Pagdilao revealed that the Land Cruisers plate number was supposed to be for a flatbed truck. The [Criminal Investigation and Detection Unit] is finding out why it was on an [SUV]. Even the anticarnapping unit has been tapped in the investigation, he said. The officer said the gun-toting man might face a complaint of grave threats. Asked about the fear-stricken familys intention to file a case against those in the Land Cruiser, Pagdilao said the police would gather the evidence to support the familys statement. Once the complaint is filed in the fiscals office, it is the fiscal who will appreciate their statements to determine if there is probable cause [to charge the suspects], Pagdilao said.",Jaymee T.

2014-05-08,,,,"MANILA - The Land Transportation Office (LTO) has released today the first batch of private motor vehicle plates with new design. The original release of the new license plates was scheduled September last year but was delayed due to issues on the release of funds by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM). The plates now have three control letters and four digits, and are white in color with black fonts. The font thickness was increased to nine millimeters from the previous seven millimeters, and font size is 70 millimeters in height and 35 millimeters in width. The new plates have the same dimension of 140 by 390 millimeters. The LTO said the new plates are loaded with security features to make it easier for law enforcement agencies to rid roads of colorum vehicles. New motor vehicles registered February 17, 2014 onwards and new motorcycles registered last September 2013 onwards will get the new batch of plates. Last month, LTO Assistant Secretary Alfonso Tan admitted that the backlog started in 2012 when the winning bidder failed to produce the license plates and car registration stickers. As of 2013, the backlog on motor vehicle plates is around 400,000 and 1 million for LTO stickers. --","From a report by Jacque Manabat, ABS-CBN News",ABS-CBNnews.com,"LTO, Department of Budget and Management",yes,2014-05-08 00:00:00,"enforcement of existing lawsordinances,license plate regulation",,,,,,,,english,,http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/05/08/14/first-look-new-motor-vehicle-plates,,,text,,821.0,,61.0,,pia,,,"license plates, traffic enforcement and violations",4.5,Straight News,,,,,,abs-cbnnews,no,,,,,FIRST LOOK: New motor vehicle plates,Neutral,,
2014-05-09,,,Vehicle users,"MANILA - The Land Transportation Office (LTO) has suspended for 3 months the license of a driver who cut and the convoy of President Benigno Aquino III on the Skyway last April 14. The Presidential Security Group (PSG) earlier said that Roxas-Chua first tried to overtake the vehicle of the Presidential Communication Operation Office (PCOO), forcing the driver to slow down and give way. Roxas-Chua continued to swerve in and out of the presidential convoy until he reached the President's car and overtook it. He was then flagged down and issued a violation ticket for reckless driving by a South Luzon Expressway (SLEx) traffic enforcer. Roxas-Chua drove at speeds of around 180 kilometers per hour, according to the PSG. The speed limit on the Skyway is 100 kph maximum for cars, jeeps and pick-ups; 80 kph maximum for buses and trucks; and 60 kph minimum for all vehicles. Roxas-Chua was meted a P1,000 fine, which he needed to settle within 15 days. However, he only paid the fine last Wednesday, according to the LTO. Aside from a suspended driver's license, Roxas-Chua will also have to undergo a seminar and an examination, the LTO said. After the incident, Roxas-Chua had allegedly said: ""Kay President pala kayo ha. Ganyan pala. Humanda ka pag nanalo si Binay at Erap, ipatatanggal kita.""

2014-10-30,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesMy family is shaken by the brazenness of these men, Inquirer publisher Raul Pangalangan said, shaking his head. Those men gave his familywife Elizabeth, son Miguel Enrico, 21, daughter-in-law Trizha O. Pangalangan and two granddaughters age 6 and 5 and their two nanniesa shock in a road rage incident in Quezon City on Monday morning, he said. Elizabeth, a law professor at the University of the Philippines, said she was sitting in the front passenger seat beside her son in the family vehicle when the incident happened. After learning the identities of the owners of the vehicles the men used, Elizabeth Pangalangan filed a complaint in the National Bureau of Investigation on Wednesday against Bulacan Mayor Patrick Meneses and his mother over the incident that she said left her family traumatized. The complainant is also the director of the Institute of Human Rights at the UP Law Center. Meneses is better known today as the partner of actress Ara Mina. He used to be with another actress, Aiko Melendez. NBI Director Virgilio Mendez said he had assigned a division to investigate the incident following the filing of the complaint. I will assign a team to conduct an investigation based on the complaint, Mendez told the Inquirer in an interview at his office on Wednesday. Mendez said Meneses and his security men and those named in the complaint would be invited to give their side of the incident. The others named in the complaint were the mother of Meneses, Priscila, who is the listed owner of one of two vehicles involved in the incident, a silver Innova with Plate No. ZEL 124; one Joel Pion; and several John Does. Elizabeth said she filed a complaint because Meneses mother refused to identify the men in the two vehicles that she and her family encountered on Congressional Avenue Extension on Monday morning. She said one of the men pointed a gun at her and her family. An initial police investigation showed that the man with a gun was from the Innova. In a visit to the Inquirer on Tuesday night to talk to publisher Pangalangan, Priscila said her family owned the Innova and the other vehicle involved in the incident, a Land Cruiser. She said, however, that she was not in one of the vehicles and that no security men were traveling in them. She said her son Patrick, mayor of Bulacan town, Bulacan province, should be spared because he was at the municipal hall at the time of the incident. She identified the driver of the Innova as Joel Pion. She also denied that her son was on board the Land Cruiser when the incident happened. My son was not on board the vehicle and the convoy was on a personal errand when the supposed encounter took place, she said. Priscila said the reported plate number of the Land Cruiser was wrong. It was not the plate number of our Land Cruiser, she said. In her complaint, Elizabeth said she and her family were traveling on Congressional Avenue Extension in their vehicle, a Fortuner, on their way to Himlayang Pilipino on Monday morning when a big white Land Cruiser with Plate No. PQS 904 moved into their lane to overtake them, nearly hitting their vehicle. She said she told her 21-year-old son, who was driving the vehicle, to move to the other lane to avoid the reckless Land Cruiser. With her in the vehicle were her daughter-in-law and two small grandchildren and their nannies. According to Land Transportation Office records, the Land Cruiser is registered to Mactan Construction Supply, a company with offices on N. Domingo Street in San Juan City. The Land Cruiser overtook the Pangalangans vehicle a second time and it was then that Elizabeth noticed the silver Innova following and realized that it was an escort vehicle. At that stage, I noticed that a silver Innova was following us closely. The Innova swerved into our lane and almost forced us off the road and onto the sidewalk, she said. The Innova drove alongside the Fortuner and a male passenger rolled down his window and began hurling invectives at the UP professors son. Then the front passenger window of the silver Innova opened and a man started shouting invectives at our car and pointing his finger and repeatedly shouting invectives, Elizabeth said. Cant you see that were escorting someone? P***** ina ninyo, Tumabi kayo, she quoted the man as saying. The Innova then picked up speed and cut the path of the Fortuner. Then the man got off the Innova with a drawn gun and pointed it at them, Elizabeth said. Elizabeth said that when she saw the gun, she yelled at the man that she had children on board. The man backed off and returned to his vehicle. The Innova then sped off. RELATED STORIES",Nancy C.

2014-11-03,,,,"MALOLOS, Bulacan, Philippines  Finally breaking his silence, Mayor Patrick Meneses of Bulakan town in Bulacan province denied having any part in the Oct. 27 road rage incident in Quezon City allegedly involving the security escorts of his mother, Priscilla, and a University of the Philippines professor and her family. I am not part of the alleged traffic incident involving my mothers vehicle and her staff, according to a text message attributed to Meneses, which was sent to Bulacan reporters on Monday. Meneses, vice president of the Bulacan chapter of the League of Municipalities of the Philippines (LMP), relayed his statement through text messages sent out by Pandi Mayor Enrico Roque, LMP Bulacan chapter president. Last week, Meneses declined requests for interviews, did not take calls or reply to text messages regarding allegations that a man believed to be part of a convoy escorting Priscilla Meneses had aimed a gun at the vehicle carrying Prof. Elizabeth Pangalangan, director of the Institute of Human Rights at the UP Law Center, and her family. The man was allegedly furious because the vehicle of Pangalangan, wife of Philippine Daily Inquirer publisher Raul Pangalangan, had disrupted the convoy. The man returned to his vehiclea silver Innovaand fled after the professor yelled at him that children were aboard her vehicle. The UP professor later filed a complaint against Meneses and his family at the National Bureau of Investigation. It is sad that my name has been dragged into this incident. As a public servant, I have worked hard to maintain a good reputation and I respect every one, whether a constituent of mine or not. I will never condone any abuse of authority, Meneses said in a text message in Filipino. I am aware that no one is above the law and I will not abuse anyone, he added. Rest assured that I will uphold the law through a thorough investigation of what really happened. Meneses text messages, however, were silent on the identity of the man who pointed a gun at the Pangalangans vehicle and on security escorts or staff members of his mother who were in the two vehicles encountered by the complainant on Congressional Avenue Extension. In an interview with the Inquirer last week, Priscilla Meneses admitted that her family owned the two vehicles involved in the incident  the Innova and a white Land Cruiser  but said she was not in any of them. Mrs. Meneses said her son, Mayor Meneses, should be spared because he was at the Bulakan town hall at the time of the incident.

In a statement, the Public Information Division (PID) of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) said the P14.3-million infrastructure project was expected to be completed by July 13, 30 days earlier than the contract duration of 90 calendar days. The PID added that Public Works Secretary Rogelio Singson had wanted the project to be finished within 60 days in time for the opening of classes in colleges that moved their academic year from June to August.

2014-05-28,,,"Government agencies, Transport sector workers","The City of Manilas decision to regulate the operations of pedicabs, tricycles and kuliglig is long overdue. Although these modes of transport may be convenient for some, they contribute to traffic congestion and can cause major traffic accidents. Manila and other local governments should not just keep them off major roads, but most of all require them to strictly follow traffic rules. Franchises do not just give them rights but, equally important, responsibilities. They should be revoked for violation of traffic rules. Many pedicab/tricycle drivers seem to think that because their vehicles are small, they can blatantly ignore rulesgoing against traffic on one-way streets, squeezing between cars, even trucks, and making turns whenever they feel like itputting their passengers and their own lives at risk. And they do it so aggressively, expecting everyone to get out of their way. Other motorists who assert their own right to use the road do so at their own peril. One motorist found his car badly scratched by a tricycle whose driver felt he should have been allowed free passage and given priority, although all other vehicles were stuck in a traffic jam. Tricycles and pedicabs usually do not have signaling gadgets that cars, buses and trucks are equipped with, but their drivers turn every which way, leaving other motorists with the responsibility of making sure accidents are avoided. Many do not even have lights for navigating city streets at night. But that does not deter drivers from operating their vehicles in the dark. (Incidentally, many jeepneys are also on the road at night without lights on.) Finally, Globe Telecom is cracking down on text spams, those annoying messages offering all sorts of products and services, from loans to real estate. Globe asked the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) to order Caritas Shield Inc. to pay appropriate fines and penalties for sending text spam to its subscribers. It also asked NTC to permanently bar Caritas, its agents and employees from sending these spam texts to Globe customers. Globe general counsel Froilan Castelo said complaints would be filed against other companies using the same marketing strategies. In asking NTC for a cease and desist order against the pre-need company, Globe said the prepaid subscriber violated the terms and conditions specified in the Users Guide set by the telecommunication company for its prepaid SIMs (subscriber information modules). Globe said the users guide stipulated that subscribers should not use the prepaid service, handset, SIM cards, call and text card for any fraudulent or abusive purpose. Subscribers can report text spams through Talk2Globe Chat (http://chat.globe.com.ph), send a message through Globe Contact Form (http://globe.com.ph/ talk2Globenow) or by tweeting @Talk2GLOBE on Twitter. They should include the number, exact message, and time and date of the text spam. Customers can also block spams through their own devices. iOS users can open the message, click the Contact button at the right hand corner, and click on the i next to the number they wish to block.

2014-05-28,,,Government agencies,"MANILA, PhilippinesAbakada Rep. Jonathan Dela Cruz has warned of shortage and unrest in the public transport sector following revelations of arbitrary, capricious and uneven application of the Public Service Law and other orders and circulars in the transportation sector by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). Considering that the opening of classes is just less than a month away, the LTFRB had better straighten up and come out with remedial plans to prevent further accidents and chaos on the streets, Dela Cruz said in a press statement. The party-list lawmaker noted in a recent hearing of the House committee on transportation that the LTFRB had been on a suspension spree in an effort to camouflage its inability to put order and discipline in the public transport sector. In one occasion, on the flimsiest of reasons, it suspended the entire fleet of two bus companiesone for three months and the other six monthseven if only one of their units had been involved in an accident, he said. This knee jerk reaction has resulted in chaos and severe public inconvenience on the routes covered by these companies. Not to mention undue proliferation of colorum vehicles and jurassic modes of transport, the Abakada congressman noted. Worse, Dela Cruz said, another bus company that was also involved in a similar accident in almost exactly the same circumstances was slapped by the LTFRB with only a 30-day suspension. Where is the equity and fairness there? he said. On other occasions, for practically the same offense, the LTFRB fined a bus company P1 million and another a pittance. All this without prior consultations or regard for the publics convenience and interest, especially in areas where the suspended companies have a significant share of the market. What then is the recourse of the riding public in the face of this wishy-washy action of the LTFRB? he asked. Worse, Dela Cruz said, the LTFRB is doing all this while everybody is preparing for the opening of classes and the demand for public transport is becoming more acute than ever. And yet, the LTFRB has yet to come out with a contingency plan.",,"6:12 AM | Wednesday, May 28th, 2014",House Representative,yes,2014-05-28 00:00:00,enforcement of existing lawsordinances,,,,,,,,english,,http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/606133/solon-hits-ltfrb-suspension-spree,,,text,,401.0,,2034.0,,candice,,,traffic enforcement and violations,5.5,Straight News,,,,,,inquirer,no,no,,,,Solon hits LTFRB suspension spree | Inquirer News,Neutral,,
2014-05-28,,,,"Government agencies are hard pressed to find a more workable solution to address congestion at the Port of Manila that has already caused prices of goods to inch up, the trade department said Tuesday. Trade Secretary Gregory L. Domingo said prices of some goods had gone up by about 3-5 percent since the expanded truck ban policy was implemented by the Manila government in February this year. Thats why we dont want this [truck congestion at the Manila Port] to become a permanent situation because it will further raise prices, Domingo added. The truck ban policy being implemented in the City of Manila bans eight-wheelers and vehicles with a gross weight of above 4,500 kilograms from plying Manilas streets between 5 a.m. and 9 p.m. A temporary concession was offered by the city government allowing trucks to ply its streets between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. during the next six months. The truck ban prompted trucking firms to hike their respective hauling charges by an average of 50 percent, which will inevitably cause prices of goods to go up. A meeting was held yesterday afternoon among the Departments of Trade and Industry, Transportation and Communications, Public Works and Highways, and Interior and Local Government to formulate solutions. We just want to look at what are the options available to make the system better given the existing truck ban policy, Domingo explained. Local and foreign business groups had warned of the serious damage that the expanded truck ban could cause the economy. They pointed out that a steady, well-managed flow of trucks with an effective appointment system will create less traffic disruption, will allow a more effective use of the port facilities and will maintain related cost at a reasonable level flow of imports and exports going [in and out of the country].",Amy R.

2014-06-03,,,,"From a measly P6,000, bus operators will soon be slapped with a P1 million fine if they will be found operating a colorum vehicle even for the first time. In a press statement Tuesday, Transportation Secretary Joseph Emilio Abaya said the imposition of heavier fine is aimed at ridding the streets of colorum or unauthorized public utility vehicles (PUVs). Safety is always our priority. Recent accidents have highlighted the needed for harsher penalties to deter illegal PUV practices and to better protect the public, he said. Abaya added that the heavier penalty is meant to show that we really mean business in putting an end to their inimical activities which put people's live at risk. The heavier fine will take effect on June 19, or 15 days after the publication on Wednesday, June 4, of or the revised schedule of fines and penalties for violation of laws, rules, and regulations governing land transportation issued by the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC), Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), and Land Transportation Office (LTO). Meanwhile, operators of colorum trucks will be fined P200,000; colorum jeepneys, P50,000; colorum vans, P200,000; colorum sedans, P120,000; and colorum motorcycles, P6,000. Aside from the fine, the colorum vehicles will also be impounded for a minimum period of three months while the entire certificate of public convenience to which the colorum vehicle belongs will be revoked together with their vehicle registrations. It will also blacklisted from being used as a PUV in the future. On second offense, the entire fleet of the erring operator will be revoked, the vehicle will be blacklisted from being used as PUVs in the future, and their vehicle registrations will also be revoked. The operator, in case of corporations, the stockholders and directors, will be disqualified from operating any kind of public land transportation. Colorum vehicles are classified as private motor vehicle operating as PUV but without proper authority from the LTFRB; PUV operating outside its approved route or area without prior permit from the LTFRB; PUV operating differently from its authorized denomination; PUV with suspended or cancelled CPC; and PUV with expired CPC and without pending application for extension of validity. In February, a bus of GV Florida fell into a ravine in Bontoc, Mt. Province, killing 14 people, including comedian Arvin Tado Jimenez. The bus was found to have no permit to operate and no registered license plate. It was thus considered a colorum vehicle and not qualified to claim insurance benefits. In March, LTFRB has revoked the franchise of 10 units of GV Florida following the crash, and suspended for six months the firm's 188 buses. Abaya said the joint administrative order covers other PUV-related violations. He clarified that it does not cover only franchise violations, but all breaches of road transport rules and regulations.

2014-06-04,,,,"Time and again, the idea of converting Baguio Citys main streets into pedestrian malls has been advocated as quickly as it is abandoned once irate businessmen step in to quash that proposal. For the last 10 years, Joseph Alabanza, former presidential assistant for urban planning, and architect Rafael Chan have championed the pedestrianization of downtown Baguio as a return to the citys cleaner and friendlier community environment. But local businessmen almost always win out by trumpeting the traffic jams that develop each time Session Road is closed to vehicles, such as during the Session in Bloom week of the annual Panagbenga (Baguio Flower Festival) in February. A prominent businessman last week said the volume of vehicles passing through city roads at a given hour has become so great, that shutting down a major street like Session Road would back up traffic all the way to the outskirts. He said pedestrianization was no longer possible for the overpopulated Baguio. On Monday, pedestrianization again became part of the conversation, partly in reaction to television news reports that the World Health Organization (WHO) has labeled the summer capital as the countrys most polluted city due to its deteriorating air quality. Bonifacio Magtibay, WHO country director in the Philippines, had written Mayor Mauricio Domogan to explain that it never made that conclusion about Baguios air quality, having focused on air quality trends over time in various parts of the world. But the WHO report does establish that outdoor (ambient) air pollution in the lower sections of downtown Baguio, much like many cities worldwide that it monitored, had failed to meet WHO guidelines for safe levels, putting people at additional risk of respiratory disease and other health problems. The Baguio Heritage Conservation Society had endorsed a central business district revitalization and sustainable mobility study to the weekly executive-legislative meeting at City Hall, which addresses the citys pollution issues. The study classified the core business center of Baguio as dysfunctional, due to factors like air pollution and traffic congestion. It said that an improved business climate for Session Road was likely once the government removes stress-producing factors like heavy traffic, pollution and the anxiety created by the congestion of people and vehicles in a relatively narrow business area. Freed from these kinds of stress, people who walk along Session Road have the tendency to spend more than people who drive through downtown Baguio, according to the study, a graduate thesis of Michelle Bacalla-Garcia, an employee of John Hay Management Corp. Garcia said she took her cue from shopping malls, which rely on sales and marketing models that describe the economies of movement or the amount of transactions that are probable within a given space. She said a heavily crowded area, like a Session Road traffic jam, reflects a trade-off in missed sales opportunities for downtown businesses and more expenses for people caught in traffic. Some entrepreneurs assume that people with vehicles are high-spending customers. Garcia said a typical motorist may spend as much as P1,500 a day, compared to a commuter who may spend as much as P800. But motorists end up spending more, like increased gasoline consumption, as they endure a traffic jam, she said. People who walk, on the other hand, have increased spending power, and are therefore potential consumers for downtown Session Road, she said. Her study also laid out a scheme for traffic calming, by proposing a universal shuttle system circling the downtown area to ferry people to the nearest jeepney or taxi routes, which would be relocated outside the downtown area. This would discourage driving to the heart of the city and reduce pollution, Garcia said. Walking is an appropriate means of travel for the citys cool weather, and is pollution-free, she said. The idea of a pedestrian mall will have higher patronage if air quality, parking and traffic congestion are addressed over time, the study said. Regardless of social sector type, Baguio residents who were surveyed agree that the current traffic system of Session Road and its peripherals does not appeal to them and perceiving a form of pedestrianization  would make the city center more attractive, Garcia said.",Vincent Cabreza,"12:45 AM | Wednesday, June 4th, 2014","City Government of Baguio, Baguio Heritage Conservation Society",yes,2014-06-04 00:00:00,pedestrianization,,,,,,,,english,,http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/608201/turning-baguio-streets-into-pedestrian-malls,,baguio,text,,137.0,,852.0,,mavie,,,nonmotorized transport,6.5,Straight News,,,,,,inquirer,no,,,,,Turning Baguio streets into pedestrian malls | Inquirer News,Neutral,,

2014-06-04,,,," MANILA - Come June 19, operating a ''colorum'' vehicle will become less appealing with higher fines scheduled to take effect. But the order is being opposed by the sector it is meant to help. The transportation department has approved higher fines for colorum vehicles. Before, the fine for all colorum vehicles is just about P6,000. With the order, fines now range from P6,000 to as high as P1 million. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) hopes the higher fines will lessen the number of colorum vehicles. But for some operators and drivers, raising fines is not enough to remove colorum vehicles from the roads. Transport group Pasang Masda fears that the higher fines could be abused by corrupt traffic enforcers in their extortion schemes. The Metro Bus Transport Club, for its part, expressed doubt the new penalties for colorum vehicles can be implemented properly. Piston, meanwhile, will launch a protest action and file a petition to stop its implementation before the Supreme Court. -",ANC,ABS-CBNnews.com,LTFRB,yes,2014-06-04 00:00:00,enforcement of existing lawsordinances,,,,,,,,english,,http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/06/04/14/higher-fines-colorum-vehicles-nixed,,,text,,402.0,,238.0,,candice,,,traffic enforcement and violations,5.5,Straight News,,,,,improvement of traffic enforcement,abs-cbnnews,no,no,,,,Higher fines for colorum vehicles nixed,Neutral,,

2014-06-04,,,,"MANILA - The city government of Makati appealed to the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to reconsider its special condition in granting the special permit for the city's free shuttle service. The city received LTFRB's order last May 21, granting a special permit for the free shuttle service. However, LTFRB ordered the city to require its passengers to buy a single journey MRT ticket and present an ID issued by a Makati-based company. In a four-page Motion for Partial Reconsideration, Atty. Pio Kenneth Dasal, city legal officer, stated that imposing the said conditions ""is an invalid exercise of LTFRB's power,"" and that these are ""contrary to public interest and welfare"". Dasal pointed out that besides defeating the purpose of a ""free"" transport service for Makati commuters, it would greatly prejudice and inconvenience them to line up and purchase a single journey ticket on the same date. ""The fact that they will not use the MRT ticket to ride the MRT trains makes such condition oppressive, as well,"" he said. The city government has also asked LTFRB to do away with the condition requiring commuters to present a company ID as proof of employment in Makati. The city counsel argued that the free transport service, offering point-to-point, non-stop trips from MRT North Avenue station to Ayala Avenue in Makati, is for the benefit of all commuters going to Makati, not just employees working in the city. The free transportation service, which started on March 27, 2014, has been conceptualized to help alleviate the burden of Makati-bound commuters caused by the long queues in MRT stations, the frequent breakdown of MRT trains and the worsening traffic conditions resulting from simultaneous road rehabilitation works along EDSA and other major roads in Metro Manila.

2014-06-04,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesWhats so special about Metro Manila jeepneys? A lawmaker and former transport official is seeking an inquiry into the latest 50-centavo increase in jeepney fares in the National Capital Region, questioning its rationale. Negros Oriental Rep. Manuel Iway, a former board member of the Land Transportation and Franchising Regulatory Board, said jeepney operators in the Visayas and Mindanao actually faced higher expenditures for fuel and spare parts, and yet they were not that keen on demanding a fare increase. It was only after the LTFRB granted the increase in the NCR and neighboring Regions 3 and 4 that operators from other parts of the country informed him that they would now consider asking for an adjustment as well. This might create a domino effect, Iway warned. He noted that diesel prices in the Visayas and Mindanao are P5 more expensive than that in Metro Manila, while spare parts for vehicles are also 15 to 20 percent more expensive in those two areas. That the operators in those regions have not sought a fare increase means they are still earning. In fact, some of them are even undercharging their passengers for longer trips, according to the congressman. The House should check if the fare increase in Metro Manilaset to take effect on June 14was really warranted, he said, adding that he would file a resolution next week asking the committee on transportation to conduct an inquiry. The LTFRB should have also checked whether the earnings of jeepney operators in the capital had really been taking a dive, he said. LTFRB Chair Winston Ginez earlier maintained that in granting the increase, the board took into account the welfare of the general public as well as an analysis made by the National Economic and Development Authority (Neda) on the impact of the fare hike. Citing diesel prices, the LTFRB said there was a need for a 37.9-centavo increase for the first four kilometers to enable jeepney operators to recover the additional expenses on fuel.",Leila B.

2014-06-05,,,,"Makati City on Wednesday asked the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board to remove what it called ""unreasonable"" conditions for a special permit for the city's free shuttle service serving Metro Rail Transit passengers. The city government questioned the LTFRB order requiring passengers of the free shuttle service to buy a single journey MRT ticket and to present an ID issued by a Makati-based company. City legal officer Pio Kenneth Dasal, in a four-page motion for partial reconsideration, said the conditions constitute adding these are contrary to public interest and welfare. The LTFRB was established for the purpose of ensuring that the commuting public has adequate, safe, convenient, environment-friendly and dependable public land transportation services. Therefore, its requirements must have a reasonable relation to its purpose, Dasal added. Under the free transport service, commuters can avail of point-to-point, non-stop trips from the MRT's North Avenue station in Quezon City to Ayala Avenue in Makati City. The city government noted the LTFRB issued last May 16 an order granting a special permit for the free shuttle service, but with the two conditions. Dasal argued the conditions would inconvenience commuters if it means they have to line up and buy a single journey ticket on the same date. The fact that they will not use the MRT ticket to ride the MRT trains makes such condition oppressive, as well, he said. With the requirement to buy MRT tickets, he asked: How could this requirement benefit the Makati commuters and also solve the long queues in MRT? Last April 2, the LTFRB required the city government to submit the government ID cards of the citys authorized representatives, the OR/CR of the buses used, Passenger Accident Liability Insurance, and Sangguniang Panlungsod Resolution regarding the free transport service. The city government submitted these requirements to LTFRB for the granting of a special permit for its free shuttle service. Its six-vehicle convoy has been regularly providing free transportation to Makati-bound commuters from Monday to Friday. Under the system, the convoy would make two trips daily from 6 to 9 a.m. from its pick-up point along North Avenue-EDSA to Ayala Avenue. Also, the city government questioned the requirement on commuters to show a company ID as proof of employment in Makati. Dasal said the free transport service, which started March 27, aims to benefit all commuters going to Makati, not just employees working in the city. The free transportation service aimed to help alleviate the burden of Makati-bound commuters who had to form long queues at MRT stations in past weeks. Meanwhile, Makati Mayor Jejomar Erwin Binay Jr. committed to buy four more new buses to augment the six city-owned vehicles used for the free transport program. Our present fleet of vehicles could only accommodate up to 250 passengers per trip, and the overwhelming response of the public to our program in its initial run has prompted our decision to add more buses, so that more citizens would benefit, Binay said.

The LTO said it has decided to increase the fines in order to deter motorists from committing traffic violations. Violations which used to cost a motorist P200 have been increased to as high as P1,000. These violations include parking in front of a private driveway, allowing passengers on top of a motor vehicle, failing to dim headlights when approaching another motor vehicle, and carrying two or more passengers in a motorcycle, among others. Drivers who will be caught under the influence of alcohol, aside from being fined, will also have his or her license confiscated and suspended for a year. Reckless drivers, meanwhile, will be fined P2,000. Succeeding offenses will require a fine of P10,000. In addition, the license of a reckless driver may be suspended for 3 to 6 months. Failure of a motorcycle rider and passenger to wear helmet merits a P1,500 fine for the first offense and P5,000 for succeeding offenses. Drivers of vehicles found to have defective accessories, devices, equipment, and parts such as horns, blinkers, brakes, early warning devices, mirrors, lights, speedometer, wipers, and license plates will be fined P5,000. Public utility driver drivers who will refuse to render service to a passenger, not give due discounts, and/or overcharge may be fined P1,000. Their operators will also be fined P5,000.

2014-06-09,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesThe Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) expressed its support on Sunday for the harsher penalties to be imposed on operators of colorum public utility vehicles (PUVs) starting next week, saying it was high time the government took a firm stance against PUVs operating without a franchise to ease traffic. We are behind the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) and the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) on this one. A bigger penalty would mean fewer colorum vehicles on the road, MMDA Chair Francis Tolentino said. He noted that at present, 401 illegal PUVs were housed at the MMDAs impounding area in Pasig City. If this [had been] implemented before, the government would have earned P401 million from fines, Tolentino said. Under the Joint Administrative Order of the LTFRB and DOTC, which will take effect on June 19, colorum bus operators will be fined P1 million; truck and van operators, P200,000; sedan operators, P120,000; jeepney owners, P50,000; and motorcycle operators, P6,000. Asked about the possibility of law enforcers using the stiffer penalties to extort money from drivers, Tolentino replied: If we are going to think about bribery and extortion all the time, we wont be able to implement any law. We need only clear implementing rules to avoid extortion activities. Another of the penalties under the DOTC and LTFRB order also calls for the impounding of the colorum vehicles for a minimum period of three months. At the same time, the DOTC will also revoke the franchise issued to the operator of the colorum vehicle. The vehicles, on the other hand, will be blacklisted so that they cannot be used again as PUVs. Meanwhile, the LTFRB has conducted a routine check of a bus firms 35 units as part of an ongoing initiative to ensure that bus operators comply with safety requirements. In a statement, the LTRFB said it recently inspected Ma-Fel Transit Corp.s terminal and garage in Quezon City in compliance with Office Order No. 2014-026 regarding the conduct of an inspection on garages and terminals and an inventory of public transport units. A team that was formed to inspect the garage and authorized units of Ma-Fel Transit Corp. located on Belfast Street corner Mindanao Avenue in Fairview found out that its 35 buses matched the franchise record held by the board. The inspection team also found out that the bus firms garage with its 2,313 square meters of open space was sufficient to accommodate all their 35 authorized units. However, the team noted that some of the buses had incomplete PUV markings such as their chassis and motor numbers. As a result, the buses were marked with their corresponding chassis and motor numbers to ensure that these matched those on the franchise record of the LTFRB.",Nia P.

In a 17-page petition for certiorari, the ""Angat Tsuper Samahan ng mga Tsuper at Operator ng Pilipinas-Genuine Organization"" or ""Angat Tsuper/Stop & Go"" asked the high tribunal to issue a temporary restraining order (TRO) on Joint Administrative Order No. 2014-01 or the ""Revised Schedule of Fines and Penalties for Violations of Laws, Rules and Regulations Governing Land. Transportation.""  Under the new policy, franchise-less public utility jeeps now stand to pay a fine of P50,000. Offenders using motorcycles stand to pay a P6,000; sedans, P120,000; vans, P200,000; trucks, P200,000; and buses, up to P1 million.  The petitioners alleged that the new policy ""was clearly focused on public utility buses.""  The petitioners said the fines imposed under the new policy were a ""thousand percent"" increase from the penalties set under Republic Act 4136 or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code of 1964.  ""Lucidly, the increase was excessive, unreasonable and oppressive, and is offensive to the due process clause of the Constitution,"" the petition read.  ""The JAO is already a restraint of trade. As the lowly driver said, 'Hindi na tayo makakapagtrabaho niyan. Katumbas ng walang trabaho iyan. Sila na lang ang ipinaghahanap buhay natin, pano na ang pamilya',"" it added.

It is set to take effect on June 19, or 15 days after it was published in the newspapers.  The operator's certificate of public convenience and registration will also be revoked. Their vehicles will also be impounded for three months.  PUVs with a franchise but transport passengers outside their assigned routes are also considered colorum vehicles.  The government said increasing fines and penalties is expected to serve as a deterrent to prevent vehicular accidents.  Named respondents in the petition were DOTC Secretary Joseph Emilio Abaya, LTO Assistant Secretary Alfonso Tan Jr, and LTFRB chairman Winston Ginez.  The petitioners said the respondents exercised grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or in excess of jurisdiction in enacting and issuing a ""vague"" joint order.

2014-06-10,,,,"There is no question that the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority has been trying its best to solve our worsening traffic woes. Its high time we tried doing things the hard way and aim at the very root of congestion, namely, vehicle volume, particularly in Metro Manila and neighboring provinces. Widening some parts of Edsa may have improved the situation but only for a while. The unabated increase of vehicle volume is the root cause of this gigantic puzzle which could turn our roads into miserable gridlocks or bring traffic to a standstill. The sales figures of the Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers of the Philippines Inc. in the first half of 2013 (87,000 cars) is indeed alarming. This could mean that in 2014, sales could easily exceed 200,000 vehicles (including trucks but excluding motorcycles). Assuming only two-thirds of this number are for Metro Manila and allowing a reduction of 20 percent for junk and accidents, we still would have roughly 106,000 additional vehicles on our metro roads this year. Assuming a car occupies a land area of, say, six meters at zero speed (the trucks and heavy SUVs will need more room), this would mean an additional occupancy of at least 636,000 square meters of road area. Since it is physically impossible to match the loss by way of constructing new roads or widening existing networks, the only way out is to limit the number of vehicles based on what would allow for comfortable traffic flow.

2014-06-11,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesTransport groups on Tuesday asked the Supreme Court to stop the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) from implementing an order setting higher penalties for public utility vehicles (PUVs) found in violation of traffic laws. The groups led by Angat Tsuper Samahan ng mga Tsuper at Operator ng Pilipinas-Genuine Organization (Angat Tsuper/Stop and Go) filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition, with application for a temporary restraining order and writ of preliminary prohibition injunction, against the DOTCs Joint Administration Order No. 2014-01. The order, which introduces a revised schedule of fines and penalties for drivers or operators cited for traffic violations, was issued June 4 by the DOTC in an effort to curb vehicular accidents involving PUVs. The new fines are set to take effect June 19. The petition, filed by Angat Tsuper/Stop and Go president Pascual Magno Jr., named as respondents Transportation Secretary Joseph Abaya, Land Transportation Office chief Alfonso Tan, and Land Transportation and Franchising Regulatory Board Chair Winston Ginez. In their 18-page petition, the transport groups asked the high court to declare the order unconstitutional. They argued that the respondents committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing the order despite having no valid delegation of legislative power. They noted that the order was enacted and issued by Tan and Ginez and was only approved by Abaya. In other words, it was not the edict of the DOTC per se but by its attached agencies. The LTO and LTFRB, being attached agencies, had no power to establish and prescribe rules and regulations relating to the enforcement of laws governing transportation, the petitioners added. They also claimed that the respondents committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing a vague order. Several provisions on the penalties for colorum, or unregistered, PUJs, for example, did not say who would pay the penaltiesthe operator or the driver. They also noted that the DOTC revised the penalties for traffic law violations based on a 2008 department order that was already declared unconstitutional by the Baguio City Regional Trial Court in May 2012 and by the Court of Appeals in November the same year. The petitioners also held that the increase in the penalties and fines imposed by the DOTC was excessive, unreasonable and oppressive, and is offensive to the due process clause of the Constitution. The latest increase in the penalties was also higher by 1,000 percent compared to those in the 2008 DOTC order, they added. Under the joint administrative order, colorum PUVs face the following fines: P1 million for bus operators; P200,000 for van and truck operators; P120,000 for sedan operators; P50,000 for jeepney operators; and P6,000 for motorcycle operators.",Christine O.

2014-06-12,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesThe Department of Public Works and Highways has disqualified San Miguel Corp. in the bidding for a P35.4-billion tollroad deal south of Metro Manila due to a technicality and will proceed with the opening of financial offers of three other groups on Friday (June 13) despite a possible appeal to be filed by the diversified conglomerate. The decision was separately confirmed by Public Works and Highways Secretary Rogelio Singson and SMC on Wednesday. The DPWH bids and awards committee had to decide on which of the four pre-qualified groups would proceed with the bidding and gain the chance to build and operate the 47-kilometer Cavite Laguna Expressway, the Aquino administrations next big-ticket public private partnership project. At the center of the issue is a deficiency in SMC-backed Optimal Infrastructure Development Inc.s offer showing that its bid security, a financial bond that protects the government, expires on Nov. 25 or short of the 180-day requirement by four days. SMC said in a statement Thursday that it disagreed with the DPWH-BACs decision in the strongest terms, adding that its issuing bank, Australias ANZ, had already clarified the matter with the government. The decision to throw out the bid of our subsidiary Optimal Infrastructure Development Inc. is prejudicial, unfair, and disregards both legal and all common-sense considerations that should be given to projects of this scale and importance, SMC said. It also cited how its removal from the process severely limits governments options on how it can maximize benefits from this project. SMC last year won the P15.5-billion NAIA Expressway Project PPP after offering to pay the government P11 billion for the right to build the toll road. We reject this decision and will explore all legal remedies available to us in order to ensure fair play and give the Filipino people the best possible deal for this vital infrastructure project, SMC added in the statement. But with the matter settled, as far as DPWH is concerned, the department will proceed with the opening of financial proposals on Friday despite any appeal that SMC would file, Singson said in a text message. The financial proposal opening would give stakeholders a good idea of which group would likely win the project. Optimal Infrastructures deficiency was first pointed out when technical proposals were opened last June 2. At least one bidder, MPCALA Holdings of the group of businessman Manuel V. Pangilinan, called for the automatic disqualification of Optimal Infrastructure, but all groups were asked by DPWH to weigh in on the matter. The action underscored the intense competition among bidders for crucial and potentially lucrative PPP projects like Cavite-Laguna Expressway, which calls for the construction of a new toll road that would help spur development in provinces south of Metro Manila. Apart from Optimal Infrastructure and MPCALA, the two other bidders are Malaysias MTD Capital Bhd. and Team Orion, comprised of Ayala Corp. and Aboitiz Land Inc. All four submitted offers last week, citing the toll roads attractive prospects. SMC said in a statement June 5 that its bid was compliant and its issuing bank, ANZ, certified to the DPWH that Optimal Infrastructures bid security is indeed valid and effective for 180 days from June 2 until Nov. 29 instead of Nov. 25. SMC said ANZs certification corrects the Nov. 25 date that was indicated in its bid package. The Calax project involves the financing, design and construction, as well as operation and maintenance of the four-lane expressway that will connect the Manila-Cavite Expressway (Cavitex) and the South Luzon Expressway (SLEx). It will start at the Cavitex toll gate in Kawit, Cavite, and end at the South Luzon Expressway (SLEx)-Mamplasan Interchange in Bian, Laguna. It calls for the construction of 12,207 meters of concrete bridges, 4,618 meters of viaducts, toll gates and interchanges in Kawit, Daang-Hari, Governors Drive, Aguinaldo Highway, Silang, Sta. Rosa, Tagaytay-Sta. Rosa Road, Laguna Boulevard and the Laguna Technopark. RELATED STORIES",Miguel R.

2014-06-14,,,,"The joint venture between Ayala Corp. and Aboitiz Land Inc. offered a premium payment of P11.659 billion, the highest bid for the Cavite-Laguna Expressway (Calax) public private partnership (PPP) deal Friday, edging out two other groups for the coveted infrastructure project, bidding results at the Department of Public Works and Highways showed. But Fridays event took an odd twist as officials of San Miguel Corp., which was disqualified days earlier due to a deficiency in its bid security, took the unusual step during the financial proposal opening to announce their premium offer of P20.105 billion, while again raising the likelihood of a legal protest that could stall the PPP deal. Because SMCs Optimal Infrastructure Development Inc. was disqualified, its financial bid was not opened within the premises of the DPWH, which is implementing the P35.4-billion toll road project aimed at spurring development in provinces south of the capital district. The two other bidders are MPCALA Holdings of the group of businessman Manuel V. Pangilinan and MTD Capital of Malaysia, the only foreign group. MPCALA Holdings offered P11.33 billion while MTD offered P922 million, their bid submissions showed. Both were also premium payments, meaning these will come on top of the cost of the tollroad, which the winner will build and operate for 35 years. Despite the specter of a lawsuit, PPP Center executive director Cosette Canilao said they would proceed with the project and likely render an award next week. This would make the Calax the third PPP project of the DPWH to be awarded after the Naia Expressway and Daang Hari-SLEx road project last year and in 2011, respectively. Canilao, who is a non-voting member of the DPWH bids and awards committee, also stood by the decision to disqualify SMC on a technicality. The issue centered around Optimal Infrastructures bid security, which expires on Nov. 25, or short of the 180-day requirement by only four days. SMC said its issuing bank ANZ later clarified the matter with the government. On the surface, the decision to invalidate Optimal Infrastructures bid over those four days denied the government an additional P8.45 billion windfall, but Canilao said the rules had to be implemented to the letter. We have to protect the integrity of the process and the program. We look at the bigger picture rather than just this particular project, Canilao said. San Miguel, however, does not see it this way and Raoul Romulo, the authorized representative of Optimal Infrastructure, told reporters they planned to study and pursue all legal avenues so their bid would be considered. The [country] and the DPWH would have been the alternate beneficiary here. Unfortunately, because of a mere typographical error, which they have allowed in the other bids, we were not given that leeway. Its a sad day for us but we hope that the remedies will see us through, he told reporters. Canilao, on the other hand, hoped SMC would not take this route. We hope they will reconsider their plans of filing a legal case because SMC is a partner of the government in several infrastructure projects and there are still a lot of PPP projects in the pipeline they would be interested in, Canilao said. The Calax project involves the financing, design and construction, as well as operation and maintenance of the four-lane expressway that will connect the Manila-Cavite Expressway (Cavitex) and the South Luzon Expressway (SLEx).",Miguel R.

2014-06-15,,,Civil society,"MANILA, PhilippineShould road courtesy be taught to elementary and high school students? A pair of lawmakers is proposing just that. Cagayan de Oro Representative Rufus Rodriguez and his brother Abante Mindanao Maximo Rodriguez Jr. filed House Bill 4160 in Congress, which proposes the introduction of a subject called road courtesy, discipline and traffic safety education to students enrolled in Grade 1 to 4thyear high school. There seems to be a growing number of traffic accidents in the country which can be attributed mainly to the sheer disregard of traffic laws or ignorance, the congressmen said in a statement. Citing World Health Organization (WHO) data, they pointed out that the share of road traffic injuries compared to the number of total deaths is expected to increase to 3.5 percent in 2030 from 2.2 percent in 2004. Traffic-related fatalities are projected to become the 5th leading cause of death behind heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lower respiratory infections. Meanwhile, WHO said 7,000 Filipinos die each year due to road traffic accidents. Since many traffic accidents are attributed to sheer disregard of traffic laws or ignorance, the lawmakers said education of students on traffic discipline will help address the problem. They said the best way to inculcate road courtesy in Philippine culture is by starting with children. Under the proposed measure, students will be taught traffic signs, rights and obligations of pedestrians and drivers, as well as laws on driving.

According to the group, the LTFRB should finalize the rules of engagement in the implementation of the new penalties and fines.

2014-06-17,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesThe implementation of the new rule that imposes stiffer penalties on operators of colorum vehicles or public utility vehicles will push through on June 19. This, after the Supreme Court defers action on the petition of a transport group questioning the legality of Joint Administrative Order No. 2014-01 or the Revised Schedule of Fines and Penalties for Violations of Laws, Rules and Regulations Governing Land Transportation. Instead, the high court, during Tuesdays session ordered Transportation and Communications Secretary Joseph Emilio Abaya, the Land Transportation and Franchising Regulatory Board (LTFRB), Land Transportation Office to comment on the petition within 10 days. Petitioner Angat Tsuper Samahan ng mga Tsuper at Operator ng Pilipinas-Genuine Organization or Angat Tsuper/Stop&Go told the high court that the new policy was vague because of its failure to indicate whether the penalty will be paid by the owner/operator or driver of the public utility vehicle. They added that the fines imposed are also a thousand percent increase from the penalties set under Republic Act 4136 or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code of 1964. Lucidly, the increase was excessive, unreasonable and oppressive, and is offensive to the due process clause of the Constitution, the petition stated. If for one reason or another, due to inadvertence, a full-time PUJ driver or family driver (or with similar occupation) earning P500 a day failed to bring with him his drivers license or lost along the way without his knowledge, if caught, then his one week earnings would be taken at the expense of his family, lose his job and could no longer work, it added. Under the Joint Administrative Orderthe fine for other first-time colorum offenders are: trucks  P200,000; jeepney  P50,000; vans  P200,000; sedans  P120,000; motorcycles  P6,000; and buses, P1 million. Apart from these fines, the colorum vehicles will also be impounded for a minimum period of three months. The entire certificate of public convenience (CPC) to which the colorum vehicle belongs will be revoked, as well as their vehicle registrations. They will also be blacklisted from being used as PUVs in the future.

2014-06-18,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesThe Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) will proceed with the implementation Thursday of significantly higher fines for colorum, or unlicensed, operators of public transport services not complying with their franchises or permits, after the Supreme Court failed to issue a temporary restraining order against the new rates Tuesday. The high court merely directed the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC), the Land Transportation Office (LTO) and the LTFRB to comment within 10 days from notice on the petition filed last June 10 by transport groups protesting the implementation of Joint Administrative Order (JAO) 2014-01 issued jointly by the LTFRB and the LTO and approved by the DOTC. The order, which covers the revised schedule of fines and penalties for violations of laws, rules and regulations governing land transportation, was issued last June 4 by the DOTC in a bid to prevent vehicular accidents involving public utility vehicles (PUVs). The LTFRB said in a statement Wednesday that the implementation of higher penalties on colorum vehicles under the JAO 2014-01 would go on schedule and start strict implementation this Thursday. Under the JAO that takes effect Thursday, colorum bus operators will be fined P1 million; truck and van operators, P200,000; sedan operators, P120,000; jeepney owners, P50,000; and motorcycle operators, P6,000. The JAO also covers other PUV-related violations such as refusal to convey passengers to their destination; overcharging; employing reckless, insolent, discourteous or arrogant drivers; operating PUVs with defective parts; using tampered taximeters; and trip cutting. Each violation has corresponding fines and penalties as specified in the order. The LTFRB is creating a nationwide task force composed of LTFRB and LTO enforcers who are the only ones authorized to apprehend violators. It has not deputized any local government unit (LGU) traffic personnel or Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) enforcer to apprehend violators. However, in response to concerns raised by some provincial transport operators, the LTFRB said it was suspending for 120 days the implementation of higher fines and penalties pertaining to out-of-line violations, or those operating beyond their designated routes. The LTFRB has issued a memorandum circular to clarify the JAO on out-of-line violations and trucks for hire. The memorandum circular also states that colorum trucks-for-hire, particularly those with white plates, upon submission of franchise application will be automatically afforded provisional authority valid for 120 days. Transport groups led by the Angat Tsuper Samahan ng mga Tsuper at Operator ng Pilipinas-Genuine Organization (Angat Tsuper/Stop and Go) asked the high court to declare the JAO 2014-01 as unconstitutional.

2014-06-18,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesA transport organization for UV Express units is asking the Land Transportation and Franchising Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to defer the implementation of significantly higher fines and penalties for operators of public utility vehicles starting June 19, saying more information from a yet-to-be completed study by the Japan International Cooperation Agency should be provided to all concerned sectors. Code-X Transport Federation, in a letter to the Philippine Daily Inquirer, said the imposition of higher penalties would be premature and untimely. The fines, announced by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board, would significantly increase the costs of companies found violating their franchises and permits. The fine climbs to as much as P1 million for colorum bus operators, under the governments joint administrative order, when the previous amount was just P6,000. We are praying for the deferment of the joint administrative order regarding increased fines and penalties, which [was] supposed to take effect June 19, 2014 until the JICA study is completed, evaluated and implemented, Code-X said in its letter. The group cited the Japanese organizations study, which would be the basis for the re-opening of new franchises or certificates of public convenience. It added that the same study could be used to determine whether to add or reduce the number of public utility vehicles on a certain route. Unfortunately, the JICA study is yet to be completed resulting in a vacuum that colorum operators are trying to fill-up, Code-X said. There are not enough new franchises to eradicate colorum operators, the group added. Yet there is high demand for vehicles to ferry the passengers to and from [their] place of work. Code-X suggested further that they be allowed some measure of self-regulation, in the same letter. As a pilot, deputized officers of some UV Express associations [can] discipline their ranks. Just like the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkasters ng Pilipinas, or KBP, which governs themselves, it said. It becomes a win-win situation. The operators and drivers win because they are given the chance to regulate themselves In doing so, the government may accomplish the task of establishing law and order, the group added. On Tuesday, LTFRB said it would proceed with the implementation starting June 19 (Thursday) of significantly higher fines for colorum operators of public transportation services not complying with their franchises or permits. But the LTFRB, in response to concerns raised by some provincial operators, said it was suspending for 120 days the implementation of these fines pertaining to out-of-line violations, or those operating beyond their designated routes. In line with this, LTFRB issued a memorandum circular to clarify the implementation of the governments joint administration order 2014-01 on out-of-line violations and trucks for hire.

''Ito lamang ay para sa mga out-of-line, iyung tinatawag natin na merong mga prangkisa pero hindi nila nasusunod kung ano ang nakalagay na awtorisadong ruta nila sa franchise. Halimbawa, may mga iba dyan na [ang ruta ay] Pasay-Dagupan, dumederecho ng Baguio,'' he said.

Some passengers complained about the lack of PUVs in Pasig and Quezon cities, where the mass actions were held. Along Commonwealth Avenue and in Balintawak and Fairview areas in Quezon City, passengers complained that they had a hard time getting a ride in the morning. The protest caravan started at the Quezon Memorial Circle. From this point, PUV drivers and operators marched through to the offices of the Land Transportation Office (LTO), Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), and Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC). Traffic build-up was also observed along Ortigas Avenue Extension, where some UV Express drivers and operators held a march to protest a policy preventing them from picking up and dropping off passengers in the middle of their respective routes. The joint administrative order imposes a much higher fine for colorum vehicles: P1 million for buses, P200,000 for trucks, P50,000 for jeepneys, P200,000 for vans, P120,000 for taxis, and P6,000 for tricycles for the first offense. Violators' colorum vehicles will also be impounded for three months and the public utility vehicles shall be blacklisted. The new order also prescribes higher fines for various traffic violations. Under the joint administrative order, only agents from the LTO and LTFRB are authorized to enforce the heftier fines.  In a statement, the DOTC said disciplined drivers and operators have nothing to fear from the new order. It also appealed to drivers not to abandon their obligation to the commuters. ''We issued the revised fines and penalties to better ensure road discipline and safety for the public. If these groups are not violating traffic rules and safety measures, then what are they protesting about? It is time for them to follow rules like everyone else, and to practice discipline and orderliness on the road,'' DOTC Secretary Jun Abaya said in a statement. ''Commuters put their safety in the hands of transport operators everyday. It is governments obligation to make sure that public utility vehicle operators are responsible in delivering their services. That is why we issued the Joint Administrative Order."" Transport groups lambasted the new order, saying this will only give corrupt traffic enforcers more reason to extort money from PUV drivers. Jun Magno, STOP & GO Transport Coalition president, said no real consultation was made by the government with the transportation sector. He also scored the government for the imposition of the higher fines, saying this is only a tool for additional revenue. He added that the LTFRB must first resolve its backlog of franchise applications before running after colorum vehicles.

They will stage their protest as they move from the Quezon Memorial Circle en route to the Land Transportation Office (LTO), Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), and Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC).

2014-06-19,,,,"An alliance of transport groups is pushing through with a protest caravan today to call for a halt in the implementation of a controversial joint administrative order imposing higher fines on out-of-line and colorum or unlicensed public utility vehicles (PUVs). This was despite an announcement from Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) Chair Winston Ginez on Tuesday that the agency would suspend for 120 days the implementation of higher fines and penalties for out-of-line PUVs under Joint Administrative Order (JAO) 2014-01 issued by the Land Transportation Office (LTO), LTFRB and approved by the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC). Starting today, colorum bus operators would be fined P1 million; trucks and van operators, P200,000; sedan operators, P120,000; jeepney owners, P50,000; and motorcycle operators, P6,000 under the joint order. The JAO also imposes corresponding fines and penalties for other PUV-related violations such as refusal to convey passengers to their destinations; overcharging; employing reckless, insolent, discourteous or arrogant drivers; using PUVs with defective parts; trip-cutting and using tampered taxi meters, among others. George San Mateo, national chair of the Pinagkaisang Samahan ng mga Tsuper at Opereytor Nationwide (Piston), said in a media forum on Wednesday that around 2,000 to 3,000 peopleor 1,000 vehicles, mostly jeepneys and UV Express vanswere expected to participate in the transport caravan. He clarified that the activity was not a transport strike. According to him, the protesters would assemble at Quezon Memorial Circle in Quezon City at 7 a.m. and head for the LTFRB and LTO offices on nearby East Avenue where they would hold a program. The group would then proceed to the DOTC building in Mandaluyong City for another rally until 3 p.m. Piston is a convenor of the No to JAO 2014-01 Alliance whose members include the Alliance of Concerned Transport Operators, Federation of Jeepney Operators and Drivers Association of the Philippines, Pasang Masda, Stop and Go Coalition and Metrobus group. An umbrella organization of several transport operators, the Stop and Go Coalition, earlier announced that 14,000 of its members would participate in what they called a voluntary transport protest. San Mateo described the JAO as unconstitutional, calling it a revenue-generation measure that was the work of Congress. He said the transport sector was not consulted before the issuance of the joint order which, according to him, may end up being used to extort more money from PUV drivers. Sometimes, you just stop to eat a block away from your route and when the authorities see you, they catch you for being out of line, he said although he admitted that at times, drivers had no choice but to alter their routes for two reasons: It was no longer profitable or the local government unitwithout any coordination with the national governmenthad told them to do so. In a related development, a transport organization for UV Express vans has asked for a moratorium on todays implementation of significantly higher fines and penalties for PUV operators, saying more information was needed from a yet to be completed study of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (Jica). In a letter to the Inquirer, Code-X Transport Federation said that the imposition of higher penalties was premature and untimely. The fines, announced by the LTFRB, would significantly increase the expenses of companies that violate their transport franchise and permits. We are praying for the deferment of the joint administrative order regarding increased fines and penalties until the Jica study is completed, evaluated and implemented, it added. The group cited the Japanese organizations study which would be the basis for the reopening of new franchise or certificates of public convenience. It added that the same study would be used to determine whether to add or reduce the number of PUVs on a certain route. Unfortunately, the Jica study [has] yet to be completed, resulting in a vacuum that colorum operators are trying to fill up, Code-X said. It claimed that there were not enough new franchise to eradicate colorum operators despite the high demand for vehicles to ferry passengers to and from [their] place of work. It went on to suggest that PUV operators be allowed some measure of self-regulation. As a pilot, deputized officers of some UV Express associations [can] discipline their ranks just like the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas or KBP, it said. It becomes a win-win situation. The operators and drivers win because they are given the chance to regulate themselves In doing so, the government may accomplish the task of establishing law and order, the group added. Meanwhile, Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) Chair Francis Tolentino said yesterday that the agency was ready to cushion the impact of the protest caravan by offering free rides to riders that may end up being stranded. We recognize the transport groups right to voice their grievances but this should not affect nor greatly inconvenience the rights of the greater majority to conduct their daily business as protected likewise by the general welfare clause in the Constitution, Tolentino announced in a statement. According to him, the MMDA will deploy its vehicles, especially buses and trucks, to ferry stranded commuters to their destinations. At the same time, he encouraged the public to use the Pasig River ferry service as an alternate means of transportation. Tolentino, who also sits as head of the Presidential Task Force on Transport Strikes and Mass Actions, said the MMDA would deploy all necessary personnel to assist affected motorists and commuters. The MMDA chief was briefed by Director Carmelo Valmoria, chief of the National Capital Regional Police Office, about the contingency measures to be taken by the police against the protest.",,", | 3:30 AM | Thursday, June 19th, 2014",,yes,2014-06-19 00:00:00,"enforcement of existing lawsordinances,colorum fines",,,,,Rally vs colorum fines set today,,,english,,http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/612366/transport-groups-up-in-arms-vs-lto-ltfrb-dotc-order,,"quezon, mandaluyong, san mateo, quezon city, manila, pasig",text,,782.0,,338.0,,pia,,,"colorum, traffic enforcement and violations",4.5,-,,,,,,inquirer,no,,,,,"Transport groups up in arms vs LTO, ltfrb, dotc order | Inquirer News",,,
2014-06-19,,,,"MANILA  Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) chairman Francis Tolentino said the agency will continue to implement an old order that metes a P6,000 fine against colorum vehicles. Tolentino said the MMDA was not deputized by the Land Transportation Office (LTO), and Land Transportation Franchising Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to enforce a joint administrative order which imposes much higher fines for colorum vehicles and various traffic violations. Nonetheless, Tolentino said MMDA enforcers as well as traffic enforcers of local government units will continue to enforce a 1997 memorandum circular which sets the fine for colorum vehicles at merely P6,000. The joint administrative order imposes a much higher fine for colorum vehicles: P1 million for buses, P200,000 for trucks, P50,000 for jeepneys, P200,000 for vans, P120,000 for taxis, and P6,000 for tricycles for the first offense. Violators' colorum vehicles will also be impounded for three months and the public utility vehicles shall be blacklisted. The new order also prescribes higher fines for various traffic violations. Under the joint administrative order, only agents from the LTO and LTFRB are authorized to enforce the heftier fines. LTFRB chairman Winston Ginez said the agency only has two teams in Metro Manila that will enforce the new order. He said more groups from LTFRB regional offices have been tasked to implement the order, alongside LTO enforcers. Ginez said the LTFRB and LTO have decided not to deputize the MMDA while the new order is in its early stages of implementation. ''Kasama sila (MMDA) dito sa aming konsultasyon, pero ang napagpasayahan ng pagpapatupad ay limitahan muna sa LTO at LTFRB sa unang bugso para maiayos at makita pa ang kailangang adjustment as we poroceed with the implementation,'' Ginez told dzMM. The new order has faced strong opposition from the transportation sector. Transport groups earlier said some of their members do not intend to ply their respective routes in protest of the new order, which introduces heftier fines for traffic violations. The groups said the drivers fear getting apprehended by enforcers for different violations such as broken tail lights, picking up and dropping off passenger in prohibited zones, among others. Jun Magno, STOP & GO Transport Coalition president, said no real consultation was made by the government with the transportation sector. He also scored the government for the imposition of the higher fines, saying this is only a tool for additional revenue. He added that the LTFRB must first resolve its backlog of franchise applications before running after colorum vehicles.",,"By Dharel Placido, ABS-CBNnews.com",,yes,2014-06-19 00:00:00,"enforcement of existing lawsordinances,colorum fines",,,,,,,,english,,http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/06/19/14/why-mmda-lgus-are-not-enforcing-steeper-fines,,"metro manila, manila",text,,784.0,,2529.0,,pia,,,"colorum, traffic enforcement and violations",4.5,-,,,,,,abs-cbnnews,no,,,,,"Why MMDA, LGUs are not enforcing steeper fines",,,
2014-06-19,,,,"MANILA, Philippines - The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) will monitor transport groups that will join the transport strike against higher penalties for colorum vehicles today, saying they could face sanctions on their franchises. In an interview, LTFRB chairman Winston Ginez cited the 2010 bus strike that paralyzed transportation in Metro Manila. Those who participated in the strike had their franchises either suspended or cancelled. The Stop and Go Coalition, an umbrella organization of several transport operators, said it has 14,000 members who are expected to participate in what they call voluntary transport protests. Workers belonging to the Kilusang Mayo Uno and other trade unions will also join the strike, according to KMU chairman Elmer Labog. The transport caravan will assemble at the Quezon City Memorial Circle before proceeding to the offices of the LTFRB along East Avenue and the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) in Pasig City. The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) will mobilize its traffic management and emergency response units to help ensure peace and order for the transport strike. We will be fielding extra number of traffic personnel along the caravans routes to keep vehicular traffic moving, said MMDA Chairman Francis Tolentino, who also sits as head of the Presidential Task Force on Transport Strikes and Mass Actions. We are ready to provide additional vehicles for libreng sakay (free ride) to serve the commuters, he added. Several trucks from the National Capital Region Police Office will also be used to ferry stranded passengers. Tolentino also called on the commuting public to monitor the MMDAs websites and Facebook and Twitter accounts for continuous traffic advisories and updates. Tolentino reminded the transport groups that while the government recognizes the transport groups right to voice their grievances, this should not affect or greatly inconvenience the rights of the greater majority to conduct their daily business as protected likewise by the general welfare clause of the Constitution. Under the DOTC-LTFRB joint administrative order issued earlier which will take effect today, colorum bus operators will be fined P1 million; truck and van operators, P200,000; sedan operators, P120,000; jeepney owners, P50,000; and motorcycle operators, P6,000. It also covers other PUV-related violations such as refusal to convey passengers to their destination; overcharging; employing reckless, insolent, discourteous or arrogant drivers; operating PUVs with defective parts; using tampered taximeters and trip cutting. The LTFRB issued an order suspending for 120 days the imposition of fines for out-of-line vehicles. Under a memorandum circular, the board will first conduct a study on the authorized route descriptions and number of authorized units in a particular route. However, the imposition of stiffer fines on other violations will still be implemented. Labog said the joint administrative order, which aims to ease traffic congestion, is obviously a money-making scheme",.

2014-06-20,,,,"MANILA - Ten ""colorum"" buses were caught by the Land Transportation Office (LTO) on Thursday, as it marked the first day of the implementation of the joint administrative order which introduces heftier fines. ""The LTO is serious in putting a stop to rampant violations of land transportation rules and regulations. As part of our reform program, one of our priorities is to instill orderliness on our roads, for both public utility and private vehicles,"" LTO Assistant Secretary Alfonso Tan Jr. said in a statement released Friday. According to Tan, the following were caught by traffic enforcers: Two Bachelor Express buses in Region 10 (one with temporary plate number 151010, the other with plate number LYE-668) were operating on ordinary routes in violation of their excursion/special trip authorization. A Buenasher Transport Corporation bus (PVH-460) in Metro Manila was plying EDSA with an expired franchise, whose last extension of validity ended in January 2013. A Lucena Lines bus (TYK-695) in Alaminos, Laguna had an expired vehicle registration and an expired franchise.

2014-06-20,,,,"MANILA, pHilippinesThe Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) refused to back down on Thursday from imposing stiffer fines on operators of colorum or illegal public utility vehicles (PUVs) even as transport groups conducted a protest caravan. We issued the revised fines and penalties to better ensure road discipline and safety for the public. If these groups are not violating traffic rules and safety measures, then what are they protesting about? It is time for them to follow rules like everyone else and to practice discipline and orderliness on the road, Transport Secretary Joseph Abaya said. Commuters put their safety in the hands of transport operators every day. It is the governments obligation to make sure that PUV operators are responsible in delivering their services. That is why we issued the Joint Administrative Order, he added. Joint Administrative Order (JAO) No. 2014-01 of the DOTC, the Land Transportation Office (LTO) and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) sets higher fines and penalties for various violations of transportation rules and regulations, including a P1 million fine for colorum buses. It took effect on Thursday, threatening the operation of illegal or unauthorized PUVs. We call on these transport groups to be responsible in serving the public. Apart from obeying traffic rules, they should not abandon their obligation to commuters, many of whom had difficulty in getting rides today. If they continue to violate the conditions of their franchise, then what is the point of having them?  Abaya said. The protest caravan organized on Thursday by transport groups to protest the JAO was a success or a flop, depending on who was talking. For the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority, the mass action failed as it did not paralyze transportation [operations] in the metropolis. It ended peacefully and we recorded no untoward incidents, Emerson Carlos, the agencys assistant general manager for operations, said in a phone interview. He estimated that although some 1,000 people were stranded as a result of the protest caravan in Quezon City, buses and military trucks offering free rides took them to their destinations between 6:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. Quezon City officials, however, cited a higher figure, saying that around 2,000 people were affected, mostly on the stretch of Commonwealth Avenue from Fairview to Philcoa, between 6 a.m. and 9 a.m. QC Department of Public Order and Safety chief Elmo San Diego said the situation normalized only after the city government deployed 20 vehicles and offered free rides to those left stranded by the mass action. For George San Mateo, national chair of the Pinagkaisang Samahan ng mga Tsuper at Operator Nationwide (Piston), the protest caravan was a success as it served to unite transport groups. This is a first for us. Before, we would gather only during strikes but this is the first time that we got together in a centralized rally, he said. According to him, more than 500 people, mostly drivers of UV Express vans and passenger jeepneys, took part in the march to the offices of the DOTC in Mandaluyong City and the LTO and LTFRB in Quezon City. There were leaders of truckers organizations (in Quezon City). For vehicles, I think there were more than 200 vehicles, jeepneys and UV Express, he said. As for the passengers who were left stranded as a result, San Mateo said it was the government that was to blame for the situation. He explained that some PUV drivers voluntarily went on a transport holiday for fear that they would be caught by traffic enforcers and fined exorbitant fees as a result of the implementation of joint order. Under the JAO, colorum or PUVs operating without a valid transport franchise would be charged higher fines: Bus operators would be fined P1 million; trucks and van operators, P200,000; sedan operators, P120,000; jeepney owners, P50,000 and motorcycle operators, P6,000. Its the governments fault. Those who did not ply their routes  got scared because of the exorbitant fees  (What they did) was voluntary, an individual initiative  They went on a transport holiday because they got scared and they just stayed at home, San Mateo said. However, he could not say how many drivers voluntarily went on a transport holiday, saying it was a spontaneous act. Supt. Cresenciano Landicho, ground commander and deputy chief of operations for administration of the Mandaluyong police, estimated the protestors who gathered in front of the DOTC at 200. San Mateo, meanwhile, said that he and other transport leaders would meet again Friday to determine what their next step would be. One of the options they were considering, he added, was a transport strike. (The DOTC) is missing the point. We are not against fines but we are against excessive fines. We will not violate the rules but these violations are administrative in nature and not criminal. If they want to make the fines P1 million, they should go to Congress and (have the offenses under JAO) criminalized, he said.

The strike, led by Pagkakaisa ng mga Samahan ng Tsuper at Operators Nationwide (Piston), prompted school officials to suspend classes in public elementary and secondary schools in the capital cities of Cebu and Roxas. Cebu City Councilor Dave Tumulak said the strike appeared to be successful, but the City Traffic Operations and Management (Citcom) said it just made it difficult for commuters to get rides. It was not total paralysis, said Rafael Yap, Citcom chief. Scores of students and workers waited for rides that did not come. The scene was common in the streets of Cebu, Mandaue, Lapu-Lapu and Talisay cities. Tumulak said commuters were caught off guard because the strike, supposed to start at 10 a.m., started earlier at 6 a.m. Greg Perez, Piston head in Cebu, said drivers are protesting the increase of fines for traffic violations to as much as P2,000. Perez said corrupt traffic enforcers would apprehend jeepney drivers for the slightest mistake to mulch from them. At least 300 drivers gathered at Fuente Osmea circle around 9 a.m. and walked more than 2 kilometers to the office of the Land Transportation Office (LTO) in Central Visayas on N. Bacalso Avenue for a dialogue with Arnel Tancinco, LTO regional chief. The dialogue ended at 1 p.m. but the drivers decided to take the entire day off. In Capiz, the strike also emptied roads of provincial jeepneys and disrupted public transport in Roxas City. Edgar Salarda, Piston-Panay coordinator, said 100 percent of jeepneys and vans and 90 percent of tricycles in Roxas City stayed off the streets.

That would translate to a total of P10 million in fines for the various operators involved under the Joint Administrative Order (JAO) No. 2014-01 of the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC), Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) and Land Transportation Office (LTO) which took effect on June 19. According to LTO Assistant Secretary Alfonso Tan Jr., the 10 passenger buses caught by traffic enforcers were the following: Two Bachelor Express buses in Region 10 carrying passengers from Butuan City to Cagayan. One of the buses with temporary plate number 151010 was plying an ordinary route in violation of its excursion/special trip authorization and no registration papers could be presented to authorities. The other bus with plate number LYE 668 was also operating on an ordinary route in violation of its excursion/special trip authorization. Buenasher Transport Corp. in Metro Manila with plate number PVH 460. The bus was plying Edsa with an expired franchise as its last extension of validity ended in January 2013. Lucena Lines in Alaminos, Laguna, with plate number TYK 695. The bus had an expired vehicle registration as well as an expired franchise. Jerel Transport Corp. (Sunrays Bus Lines) in Region 7 with plate number GWF 633. Two Super 5 buses in Region 5, both carrying Manila-bound passengers. The bus with plate number PIA 826 was on its way to Manila from Surigao. The other bus with plate number UVC 699 originated from Davao to Manila. AOM Bus with plate number 051206 also in Region 5, carrying passengers from Naga City bound for Legazpi City. Dalin Liner in Region 2 with plate number BVB-591 and Nelbusco, also in Region 2, with plate number BVK 502. The LTO is serious in putting a stop to rampant violations of land transportation rules and regulations. As part of our reform program, one of our priorities is to instill orderliness in our roads for both public utility and private vehicles, Tan said in a statement. These colorum buses have been impounded in accordance with JAO 2014-01 and the fines will go straight to the national treasury once paid. Let this be a warning to colorum operators. The LTO will enforce traffic rules for the sole purpose of ensuring safety in land transportation, he added. Under the joint order of the LTO and LTFRB which was approved by the DOTC, colorum or PUVs operating without a valid transport franchise would be charged higher fines. Buses operators would be fined P1 million; trucks and van operators, P200,000; sedan operators, P120,000; jeepney owners, P50,000 and motorcycle operators, P6,000. Meanwhile, a commuters group stood pat on its earlier decision to file a complaint against transport leaders who led a protest caravan that left at least a thousand commuters stranded in Metro Manila on Thursday. In a text message to reporters, National Center for Commuter Safety and Protection (NCCSP) president Elvira Medina threatened to sue the caravan participants for discontinuance of service as a violation of the [certificate of public conveyance]. On Friday, Medina said that they would push through with the filing of complaints, not only with the LTFRB, but also in court, against the caravan leaders who staged the protest against the stiffer fines for colorum vehicles. We understand that [they] have freedom of expression. But we have to show everyone concerned that there are parameters in the exercise of your rights.

2014-06-22,,,Government agencies,"MANILA, PhilippinesThe Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PCCI) has urged the government to defer the implementation of an administrative order imposing stiffer penalties on traffic violations, as this may only aggravate the congestion at the port of Manila. In a statement, PCCI president Alfredo M. Yao explained that the organization is not against the intent of Joint Administrative Order (JAO) No. 2014-01, which was issued by the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC), the Land Transportation Office and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) last June 2. The order, which was designed to ensure public road discipline and safety, imposes penalties ranging from higher fines to revocation of the registration of the apprehended vehicle and all other authorized units included in the franchise. He stressed, however, that the timing of the implementation is misplaced. According to Yao, the JAO may lead to a shortage of trucks, aggravating the ill effects of the port congestion in Manila which was made worse by the daytime Manila truck ban policy, which has since disrupted the flow of goods in and out of the country. The congestion has already led to higher truck rates, a container pileup at the Manila ports, delays in shipment deliveries and higher costs of goods. We have not yet recovered from losses caused by delivery delays, disruptions in our businesses and additional costs that resulted from the port congestion. We need some more time to address this issue first before the full implementation of JAO. Otherwise, there might be no more goods to sell in the markets if trucks and similar vehicles to move goods are prevented from doing so at this time, Yao explained. While the effects of the congestion has somewhat eased because of the opening of 24/7 express lanes on certain Manila thoroughfares, transport stakeholders project that the situation at the ports could still take months to normalize, he said. We hope the government grants our request to defer the implementation. This problem of truck shortage will especially be acute for perishable commodities for consumption or as raw materials in production. Instead, the PCCI is urging the LTFRB to expedite and rationalize its processing of franchises to ensure that only legitimate operators are granted approval. RELATED STORIES",Amy R.

2014-06-23,,,Civil society,"MANILA-PhilippinesApparently to complement the recent increase in fines imposed on colorum or out-of-line public utility vehicles, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) is considering raising the fines for jaywalkers as it cited the alarming number of accidents involving undisciplined pedestrians. We have been recording a high number of road accidents involving pedestrians. Perhaps we should also increase the fines for jaywalking, MMDA Chair Francis Tolentino said Sunday on his agencys weekly radio program. From 2010 to 2012, the MMDA recorded 15,500 pedestrian-related accidents, of which 495 resulted in deaths. Based on the 2012 figures, Quezon City has the most number of fatal accidents. In 2013, around 5,800 pedestrians figured in road accidents on Metro Manila roads. The rate of the pedestrian-related accidents is so high and a lot of people involved in them are jaywalkers, Tolentino noted. With pedestrians (and not motorists) violating traffic rules, they end up being hit and run over even by small vehicles. Despite the construction of footbridges and designation of zebra lanes, a lot of pedestrians still choose to jaywalk and risk life and limb, he added. In 2012, the Metro Manila Council, the policy-making body of the MMDA composed of the mayors of the 17 local governments in the capital, issued a resolution increasing the penalty for jaywalking from P150 to P200. Violators, however, are asked to choose between paying the fine or attending a 30-minute seminar on disaster response and assistance given by the MMDA, according to Assistant General Manager for Operations Emerson Carlos. Tolentino noted that even the local government units which enforce the same rules on jaywalking should now consider increasing their respective penalties.",Nia P.

2014-06-23,,,,"Why are drivers and operators of public utility vehicles afraid of the higher penalties for colorum vehicles and traffic violators if they do not intend to break the law? No matter how high the penalties are, it wont affect them if they obey traffic laws, rules and regulations. The fine for a colorum vehicle goes as high as P1 million. So what? If you are not operating a colorum vehicle, it does not make any difference to you. And if you are a law-abiding driver or operator, you wont have to pay any fines. On the other hand, the fear of stiff fines will make drivers drive carefully, and avoid accidents and traffic violations. The same fear will also force the operators not to field buses that have no franchises. One reason we have a chaotic traffic in Metro Manila is the lack of discipline among drivers. Another reason is the presence of many colorum vehicles. It has been estimated that as many as 20 percent of buses plying Edsa are colorums. But it is difficult to apprehend them because it takes time to scrutinize their permits and the records at the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). LTFRB records show that there are only so much buses plying Edsa, just enough to service commuters. But Edsa is crammed with half-empty buses at all hours, crawling bumper-to-bumper, with very few passengers even during rush hours. There are simply too many buses on Edsa. The desperate competition to get passengers and lack of accountability make bus drivers drive carelessly and violate traffic rules. Another reason is the boundary systemwhere drivers pay the bus, jeepney or tricycle operators a fixed amount; what is left of their earnings after paying the boundary becomes their take-home pay. The Department of Transportation and Communications and the Department of Labor and Employment should concentrate on the abolition of the boundary system next. * * * The government and the farmers are spraying massive doses of chemical pesticide on coconut trees infested with the pest that has been christened cocolisap. The tiny insect pests suck the life out of coconut trees. The use of massive doses of pesticide always has dangers. The largely invisible pesticide affects birds, other insects, animals and even humans. Read Rachel Carsons classic Silent Spring to know how pesticides affect the environment. But how do you kill the pests? There is another way, without using pesticides: biotechnology. Biotechnology consists of breeding pest-resistant varieties of plants and trees. Because of this natural resistance, they can survive without chemical pesticide. For example, eggplants are susceptible to tiny worms. They may look beautiful on the outside but inside they would be infested with these worms. So farmers are forced to use pesticide to kill the pests. But the trouble with these pests is that they become immune to the pesticide; so the farmers are forced to spray the plants with bigger and bigger doses of pesticide. Those eggplants with smooth, shiny skin you see in supermarkets are loaded with pesticides that may accumulate in the bodies of the humans who eat them and may harm them. Wash those beautiful eggplants thoroughly before cooking them. Better yet, peel the skin first. On the other hand, biotechnology can breed eggplants that are naturally resistant to these pests without any need for the application of pesticides. Filipino scientists have already bred a naturally pest-resistant variety: the Bt talong. This is advantageous to the farmers and the environment. It will save the farmers the cost of the pesticide and will save them from the health risks posed by chemical pesticides. It will also decrease the level of chemical residue in the soil and the vegetables we eat. The trouble is a European environment group called Greenpeace is opposing biotechnology on the grounds that you never know what this will bring. It has workers and allies here in the Philippines who are now bent on stopping our scientists from the University of the Philippines Los Baos (UPLB) from developing and introducing plant varieties using modern biotechnology. Greenpeace does not want these plant varieties adopted here. Its local allies and collaborators have brought our scientists to court and got the Court of Appeals to stop the scientists from completing field trials. UPLB appealed to the Supreme Court to allow it to resume its trials. But Greenpeace is not about to let that happen. It has hired the best Filipino lawyers to thwart the efforts of Filipino scientists. The Supreme Court case may have far-reaching consequences: Greenpeace may get the Court to impose a permanent ban on field trials for crop varieties developed by biotechnology. When that happens, Filipino farmers will continue to be dependent on chemical pesticides whose use poses dangers to the environment and to humans. * * * In reply to queries from fans of Aliw Awardee Margaux Salcedo on her next gig at the Tap Room of the Manila Hotel, it is tomorrow, Tuesday, June 24.

2014-06-23,,,,"MANILA, Philippines  What to do with the unredeemed car plates rusting at the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority?

These plates were never redeemed by the traffic violators. Imagine, we have 16,000 car plates. Those can be made into a small bridge when melted, Tolentino said. Tolentino believed most plates would no longer be claimed, with some of them dating back to 1994. The MMDA chief, however, noted that the agency still could not decide yet what to do with the plates. We can write court administrators if these can be used as evidence in traffic cases or inform the Land Transportation Office about the matter. If possible, we can sell them as souvenir plates like what is being done in the US, Tolentino said in a text message noting that the unclaimed car plates were proof that the MMDA has been doing its job in enforcing traffic rules. The license plates have accumulated through time since traffic violators no longer come back to the MMDA to pay the corresponding fines of the violations committed to claim them. In the MMDAs practice, the license plates are taken down and detached from the apprehended vehicle by MMDA enforcers whenever the erring drivers or owners refuse to surrender their drivers license.

MMDA Chairman Francis Tolentino said the plates may be sold as souvenirs or melted to build boats. ""In other countries, old vehicle plates are recycled and sold as souvenirs. We can also have them melted down to build boats,"" he said.

It only shows unscrupulous motorists might have used fake ones, or manage to have it replaced simply by having an affidavit of loss, Tolentino said. Many of these plates were confiscated from motorists who committed serious traffic violations such as colorum and out-of-line, driving without license, illegal parking, reckless driving and fake drivers license. Of the 22,628, illegal parking constituted the most number of traffic violations, with 4,595; followed by reckless driving, 4,017; unregistered vehicles, 3,238; out of line, 2,757; and colorum, 2,184.

2014-06-26,,,,"A third group from the transport sector has asked the Supreme Court to strike down a government order imposing harsher penalties for public utility vehicles caught violating traffic rules. In its petition, the National Confederation of Transportworkers' Unions (NCTU) branded Joint Administrative Order (JAO) No. 2014-01 or the Revised Schedule of Fines and Penalties for Violations of Laws, Rules and Regulations Governing Land. Transportation as unauthorized, unreasonable, and unconstitutional. The group said the JAO was beyond the legal capacity of the government agencies that created it because they do not have quasi-legislative power to refines and penalties. The petitioner said the JAO is unreasonable for its extortionate or excessive fines, and also unconstitutional for usurping the legislative powers of Congress. In short, JAO 2014-01 is illegal, unjust and a form of legal extortion,"" said Ernesto Cruz, NCTU national chairperson. Romeo Macailao, NCTU secretary general, stressed that their group respects and supports road courtesy and safety, as well as programs and policies for the well-being of the riding public. But the government should not use JAO 2014-01 at the expense of the lowly transport workers and small-time operators, he said. Under the new policy, franchise-less public utility jeeps now stand to pay a fine of P50,000. Offenders using motorcycles stand to pay a P6,000; sedans, P120,000; vans, P200,000; trucks, P200,000; and buses, up to P1 million.  The order was issued by the Department of Transportation and Communication, the Land Transportation Office, and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board. It took effect June 19.  The operator's certificate of public convenience and registration will also be revoked. Their vehicles will also be impounded for three months.  PUVs with a franchise but transport passengers outside their assigned routes are also considered colorum vehicles. Other PUV-related violations include the refusal to render services to the public or to convey passengers to their destination; overcharging; employing reckless, insolent, discourteous, or arrogant drivers; operating PUVs with defective parts and accessories; using tampered taximeters; trip cutting; and others.  The government said increasing fines and penalties is expected to serve as a deterrent to prevent vehicular accidents. Two other petitions had been filed earlier contesting the controversial JAO, , and . In its petition, Angat Tsuper/Stop & Go alleged that the new policy was clearly focused on public utility buses.  The petitioners pointed out that the fines imposed under the new policy were a thousand percent increase from the penalties set under Republic Act 4136 or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code of 1964. Meanwhile, Ximex Delivery Express, Inc argued that the JAO was arbitrary, oppressive and confiscatory in violation of the Constitution. The company also said the new policy was issued without regard to its negative economic consequences. Ximex further argued that the order penalizes the owner or the operator of the vehicle without giving the driver the opportunity to disprove claims against him or her.

The rain hampered visibility in some areas, while floods prompted local governments to deploy vehicles to give free rides to stranded commuters. In Mandaluyong City, the local government started a ""Libreng Sakay"" to ferry commuters stranded by the flash floods. A report by GMA News' Susan Enriquez on ""24 Oras"" said traffic was slowed in Pasig City, including the corner of EDSA and Ortigas Avenue. Many commuters in Quezon City were surprised by the heavy rain and were stranded at the North EDSA area. In Manila, rain was also heavy at the Rizal Park area while visibility was near zero in parts of Pasay City. Many commuters were also stranded near the Manila City Hall. Meanwhile, flooding at MacArthur Highway in Valenzuela City had subsided at 5 p.m. On the other hand, the Skyway said that as of 5:16 p.m., the Don Bosco, Amorsolo and Buendia areas were not passable to vehicles. Traffic bound for Pasay-Manila at the Skyway area was heavy as of 5:18 p.m., with the tail end at Nichols. PAGASA at 6 p.m. issued another , which it said is due to a low-pressure area. Covered by the rainfall warning were Zambales, Nueva Ecija and parts of Pampanga, Tarlac, Laguna and Bataan, which it said may expect flooding in low-lying areas.

But the CA upheld the cancellation of the Certificates of Public Convenience of 10 bus units under benificial ownership of the company. The company's legal counsel Atty. Alex Versoza said they are waiting for documents from the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA). TESDA will be releasing the certification of training and evaluation for GV Florida's drivers on Tuesday or Wednesday, the report said. The certifications will allow the bus company to redeem their confiscated plate numbers from the LTFRB. The LTFRB has yet to receive the copy of the court order but said they are studying their legal options. Fourteen people were killed including comedian Arvin ""Tado"" Jimenez when a GV Florida bus they were riding fell down a ravine in Mountain Province last February. It was found that the bus and was using fake license plates. The family of the passengers involved in the accident will meet to talk about their collective action regarding the court order.

On Thursday morning, Ingco, while on board his blue Maserati Ghibli, allegedly insulted and punched Adriatico several times, dragging him from the intersection of G. Araneta and Quezon Avenues to Scout Chuatoco street. Kakaliwa po ako ng Q. Ave. pero napansin ko na bawal kaya nag-U-turn ako pero napansin ko vinideo niya ako (I was about take a left turn at Q.

But when he got near where the enforcer was standing, he saw Adriatico continuing to take a video of him. Irked, Ingco said he lowered his window, approached Adriatico and said, Boss, ano ba ang problema? Wala naman po akong viniolate sa traffic rules (Boss, whats the problem? Im not violating any traffic rules). Pero habang vinivideo niya ako inano sa mukha ko tapos hinawi ko po yung video. When Ingco tried to push Adriatico away, he said the enforcer hit him in the face. Ingco said he sustained bruises and cuts in his arm from Adriaticos assault. After non, minura niya ako. Galit na galit siya sa akin eh. Papatayin daw nya ako (After that, he cursed me. He was fuming. He said he was going to kill me), he added. Contrary to Adriaticos narration that the sports car owner hurled expletives at him, Ingco vehemently denied this and said: Thats not true. He was grabbing my shirt while I was driving. I really wanted to escape. I was scared. Wala akong pwersa. Nasa loob po ako ng sasakyan. Kung gusto ko siyang saktan, ihaharurot ko na yung sasakyan. Ingco also denied snatching Adriaticos cellphone. I cant understand why hes taking a video of me. I didnt do anything wrong, he added.

In a live interview on ""TV Patrol,"" Ingco claimed that it was MMDA traffic constable Jorbe Adriatico who first slapped him. According to Ingco, he was supposed to turn left from Araneta Avenue going to Quezon Avenue when he noticed that it was prohibited. Instead of turning left, he went straight and used a u-turn slot along Araneta Avenue before turning right on Quezon Avenue. While he was driving, he noticed Adriatico taking a video of him. He then stopped and confronted Adriatico, asking him why he was taking a video. ""Nagbaba po ako ng bintana, sabi ko po 'Boss, ano po ba ang problema?"" Wala naman po akong na-violate na traffic rules,"" Ingco added. Adriatico continued taking a video, even pointing the cellphone directly into Ingco's face. This caused the latter to slap Adriatico's hand away from his face. ""Hinawi ko po 'yung video. Noong nahawi ko na po, hinampas niya po ang mukha ko. Pagkahampas niya po sa mukha ko, hawak-hawak niya po ang braso ko. 'Yung isa ko pong kamay, nasa manibela lang po,"" Ingco narrated. He said he tried to free himself from Adriatico's grip by moving away from him. He also admitted that he slapped Adriatico twice so he can escape from his grip. ""Totoo po 'yun kasi hawak hawak niya ako, gusto ko pong makawala sa kanya. Wala ho akong pwersa kasi nasa loob ho ako ng sasakyan. Lahat ng pwersa nasa kanya, siya ho ang nasa labas eh,"" Ingco said. Contrary to what Adriatico earlier claimed, Ingco said it was Adriatico who was threatening to kill him. ""Minumura niya po ako eh, galit na galit po siya sa akin, papatayin daw niya po ako. Hawak-hawak niya po 'yung damit ko. Gusto ko lang po makaalis po sa kanya kasi natatakot na po ako,"" he added. Adriatico, who was allegedly punched by Ingco, said on Thursday that he pleaded for his life after being dragged by the driver of the sports car.

Edgar Padernal, Ingco's lawyer, said they are ready to face the charges filed against the businessman. He also denied that his client is hiding from authorities, adding that he cannot be arrested without a warrant. Ingco has been charged with serious physical injury, direct assault upon an authorized officer and grave threat, as per the Quezon City Police District. According to Padernal, they found evidence that another motorist previously filed a complaint against Adriatico for abuse of authority. ""May nag-file na nang complaint sa MMDA chairman, na 'yung enforcer din, nag-vivideo din. Masyadong abusado 'yung enforcer, pinapagpark 'yung kotse.

We respectfully request for the immediate revocation of the drivers license of Joseph Russel Ingco as we believe that Mr. Ingcos action was a clear and blatant disregard of authority and grave abuse of a privilege of being granted a drivers license, the letter read.

2014-07-06,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesHe may have escaped unscathed after his car collided with a train in Manila on Friday morning, but Jerome Brieva will not escape charges for allegedly causing the accident in the first place. He will have to pay a fine of P2,000 at least. The 36-year-old project coordinator of a construction company faces charges of reckless imprudence resulting in damage to property for the accident, said SPO4 Sergio Macaraig, the Manila District Traffic Enforcement Unit investigator on the case. Brieva, who was driving a grey Nissan Navarra southbound on Jose Abad Santos Avenue in Daang Bakal, Tondo, had earlier stopped at the intersection with Antipolo Street to let a westbound train pass. But as he crossed the street after the train passed, he was hit by an eastbound train. He was trapped in the middle of the railroad tracks, Macaraig said in a telephone interview. The traffic was bad at that time, so he couldnt maneuver out of the trains way. Macaraig said Brieva had driven onto the tracks despite seeing the warning signs still active. The boom, meant to keep cars out of the tracks when a train passes, had lifted after the first train passed. Maybe he was in a rush, so when he saw the cars move a bit and a gap appeared on the track, he slotted in, the investigator added. His car was dragged a few meters after the impact before the train was able to stop. The car was a total wreck, its right side crumpled, and at least one of the cars tires had fallen off. Macaraig said Brieva was not drunk when the accident happened. He told us that he was just really trapped in between the tracks then. He was lucky that he just bumped his head and that he didnt suffer a more serious injury, Macaraig said. Macaraig said the charges filed against Brieva will mean settling a fine of P2,000 at the City Hall. There is no jail term for the offense. RELATED STORIES",Nathaniel R.

2014-07-14,,,,"The recent announcement of the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) of various new transportation infrastructure projects is welcome news. These projects are designed to increase urban mass transport ridership to 2.2 million per day. Five of the six announced projects deserve support for their soonest implementation: 900-kilometer Luzon north-south railway, bus rapid transit (BRT) from Manila to QC, MRT7 from North Avenue to San Jose in Bulacan, LRT2 extension to Masinag in Antipolo, and LRT1 extension to Dasmarias in Cavite. These five projects will help redress the deficient transportation system in Luzon and Metro Manila. Once completed, the Luzon Railway will erase the unflattering distinction we have of being the only country in the region without a railroad system. More efficient, convenient and affordable transportation of people and commodities will foster stronger and more sustainable economic growth in the long term, creating more business opportunities and jobs. The other one, the P135 billion 20-kilometer subway dubbed by DOTC Mass Transit Loop System to run from Bonifacio Global City (BGC) to Ayala Center and Pasay City reclaimed area, merits a serious think-over. It will be a nice showcase facility to have, particularly if undertaken entirely with private funds and without government subsidy. But it is more technically complex, very expensive and will take longer time to build. The reclaimed area and other low-lying areas will be an engineering challenge. The high cost-to-ridership ratio may impinge on its viability. If not for the existing MRT3, Edsa would be an appropriate corridor to build a subway as it is the most important and congested traffic and commuter corridor in Metro Manila serving over half a million commuters daily. So many commuters will be thankful if such a huge P135 billion for the proposed BGC subway be instead invested to drastically improve the EDSA MRT3 to make it a showcase commuter line. The upgrade will spare them from suffering the very crammed coaches and stations, and time consuming queues, especially during peak hours. Service interruptions that occasionally occur will also become a thing of the past. There is no question mass transit is needed in a densely populated metropolitan Manila. But a subway is not the only answer to the intended destinations. There are other more viable and doable solutions to more quickly help alleviate traffic congestion and commuters need. Viable mass transit alternatives are a system employing a series of rubber-tired buses running like a train called bus rapid transit (BRT) and city tram cars on rails. Both are proven elsewhere to be efficient people movers. The carriageway alternative is an urban loop expressway, consisting of ground and aboveground roadways that will have a longer route and serve more commuters. Such alternatives can cover the same destinations as the proposed subway plus many other important destinations, including Naia, Newport City and interlink with more mass transit stations of MRT3, LRT and PNR. These transit and carriageway alternatives will cost much less, easier and faster to complete and will benefit more commuters. Except for the Naia Expressway, which is a PPP project, the other segments of the expressway should be toll-free as it will combine existing major at-grade roadways connected to existing and new skyways. The possible route and transit stations are BGC-Lawton Ave.-SLEX/PNR- Newport City-Naia Expressway T3/4/2/1-LRT1 Baclaran-Entertainment City-MOA-Buendia/LRT1 Taft-PNR Osmena Highway-Ayala/Buendia-Buendia/Makati Ave.-Kalayaan skyway-BGC 32nd Ave./St. Lukes. If a subway is desired, a short one may be done at BGC under the congested 5th St. to link 32nd Avenue to Lawton Avenue. Some of the road upgrades needed in certain segments of the proposed expressway are already being planned. They are the widening of a short stretch of Lawton Avenue at the ongoing West McKinley development and the intersection separation at Buendia/Paseo de Roxas and Buendia/Makati Avenue. But these piecemeal efforts must be expanded and integrated to comprise a complete loop expressway. The existing Kalayaan skyway and the soon to be completed Naia Expressway coupled with the existing yet upgradeable Lawton Avenue in Fort Bonifacio and the long arterial Buendia Avenue stretching from Pasay to Makati present an opportunity for interconnection that must be quickly exploited and upgraded to develop the first urban east-west loop expressway in the country. This will complement the SLEX-NLEX north-south connector expressway and the DOTC proposed subway, if it comes to fruition. Necessarily, the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) must take part to undertake the needed road grade separations with overpasses at certain intersections, upgrade the entire Lawton Avenue into a 6- or 8-lane intersection-free parkway to be connected to the Naia Expressway at SLEX junction and construct a new skyway to overpass the flood and traffic-prone Buendia Avenue from Pasay to Makati. Doing so will provide continuous all-weather traffic flow on the entire loop expressway for both mass transit and road vehicles alike. The Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) must also play its part to preserve the needed road right-of-way, particularly for the expansion and conversion of Lawton Avenue into a parkway before the same is preempted by ongoing development by private developers. Foresight and forward planning are needed for better infrastructure. With the fiscal space now available to the government and so much liquidity, the opportunity is at hand to undo over half a century of neglect and underinvestment in road and transport infrastructure that has caused so much inconvenience to the people and hobbled the economy from achieving its full potential. An urban expressway is not a novel concept for quick circulation of vehicles. It is a common feature of highly congested cities. In Hong Kong, a high speed freeway stretches along the harbor from Quarry Bay, at the eastern end to the western end of the island via central, providing a high-speed intersection-free roadway to provide access to the financial district and from all three cross harbour tunnels to Kowloon. The same can be found in Kowloon, Tokyo, Taipei and New York City, among others. What remains is for policy makers and implementers to grab this opportunity and quickly complete by 2016 this first Metro-Manila urban transit expressway with mass transit.

2014-07-14,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesTo reduce the number of truck ban violators, especially on C5 Road and the Katipunan area, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) will be increasing the fine from P500 to P2,000. On top of this, it will also recommend the one-year suspension of the driving license of three-time offenders. Already approved by the Metro Manila Council (MMC)the policy-making arm of the MMDAthe stiffer penalties were prompted by the agencys observation that more and more truckers were deliberately violating the ban just to be able to make their deliveries because they could afford to pay the fine. On the MMDAs weekly radio program on Sunday, MMDA Assistant General Manager for Operations Emerson Carlos said that they have apprehended more than 20 violators per day on C5 Road and Katipunan for the past months. We also received information that truck operators provide the truckers with an additional P500 to cover the fine, he noted, adding that the amount had become part of the drivers expenses. We cannot let that continuously happen as it affects traffic on major streets, especially near universities, he said. During the MMCs meeting on Tuesday, MMDA Chair Francis Tolentino said that the council agreed to raise the P500 penalty, which has been in effect since 1995. He also noted that the higher penalty would take effect 15 days after its publication. To better enforce the ban, Tolentino added that the MMC was planning to ask the Land Transportation Office to ban a trucker from driving for a year after three violations. Under the truck ban, trucks and other vehicles with a weight of 4,500 kilograms or more are banned from major thoroughfares between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. and from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. on weekdays, except holidays. All trucks, however, are prohibited from plying Edsa from Magallanes in Makati to North Avenue in Quezon City every day. Only trucks and vehicles carrying perishable items and petroleum products are exempted from the ban. Sought for comment, Mary Zapata, president of the Aduana Business Club Inc. (ABCI), an organization of truckers, importers, exporters and licensed brokers, said that the increase in fines was not a welcome development. Its part of confusing regulations, particularly between the old measures and new ones like these, she said in a telephone interview. Zapata added that while concessions, such as the 24-hour truck lane on Roxas Boulevard, were helpful in helping them complete their deliveries, other new measures might be confusing to truckers. This presents a new problem to truckers. Which truck ban will this become part of? There are so many clarificatory points we have to talk about, she said. Zapata said that the ABCI would wait for a copy of the MMC resolution before they discuss their next move. When asked by the Inquirer, she said that she did not have figures for how many of their members had been apprehended for violating the truck ban in different parts of Metro Manila. However, many of them got caught violating the truck ban because of [certain] situations, she said, stressing that most of those who were apprehended did not violate the ban deliberately. There are situations that the drivers cannot control. [In those] cases, we need common sense to prevail. Enforcers should be aware of the situation, Zapata pointed out.",,", | 2:11 AM | Monday, July 14th, 2014",Metropolitan Manila Development Authority,yes,2014-07-14 00:00:00,formulation of legislationlocal ordinances,,,,,,,,english,,http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/619344/fine-for-truck-ban-violators-increased,,"quezon, metro manila, quezon city, makati, manila, roxas",text,,395.0,,1187.0,,candice,,,policy and legislation,5.5,Straight News,,,,,improvement of traffic enforcement,inquirer,no,yes,city or municipality wide,,,Fine for truck ban violators increased  | Inquirer News,Neutral,,

2014-07-16,,,,"Floods are again expected as Typhoon Glenda barrels into the Philippines. While the Bicol region will feel the brunt of the typhoon, it is expected to bring heavy rains to Metro Manila, which means floods will, as usual, engulf many streets and homes. How can we prevent floods after every heavy rainfall? By wise planning, said Sen. Serge Osmea and Buhay party-list Rep. Lito Atienza at the Kapihan sa Manila at the Diamond Hotel last Monday. But the Metro Manila Development Authority has no plans, the two lawmakers said. It reacts only when the floods are already there. The MMDA solution is to set up an MMDA office on Espaa where floods are usually deepest (as MMDA Chair Francis Tolentino once said during a heavy flood). What good will that do? smirked Atienza, a former mayor of Manila. That office will not prevent any flood. Atienza added: The answer is planning, but the MMDA has no plans. One problem is in the numerous street diggings all over the metropolis that block the flow of water through the underground pipes. Doesnt [Public Works Secretary Rogelio] Singson see that? The same is true of the traffic problem, of which the MMDA and the Department of Transportation and Communications have no plans, the two Kapihan guests said. Every commuter sees what the problem istoo many vehicles on too few roadsbut the people in charge of transportation and traffic have no plans to solve it. For example, there are too many buses on Edsa, many of them colorum, most of them half-empty even during rush hours, wasting precious fuel and adding to the air pollution. They take much space of the avenue. Why cant the DOTC get rid of the colorum buses? Increasing the fines for colorum buses to P1 million wont do it. It will only increase the rate of tong of traffic enforcers. And how can we catch the colorum buses when the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board does not even know which bus lines have franchises? We asked the LTFRB to give us a list of buses with valid franchises, and it cannot show us any, said Atienza. How can it know which buses are colorum? Then there are the private vehicles. Every year, the car assemblers pour about 300,000 new cars into the streets, most of which end up in Metro Manila. That does not include the vehicles smuggled into the country and the jeepneys assembled from discarded parts in the provinces of Cavite and Laguna. But old vehicles are not phased out; they stay on and on and on. Where are we going to put all of these vehicles when too few new streets are being constructed? An efficient mass transit system can move people around quickly, but our mass transit system is also in a mess, the congressman added. There are not enough LRT and MRT trains. The available ones are often in disrepair. The lines of passengers waiting to buy tickets are sometimes half a kilometer long. When they do get a ride, they are packed like sardines inside the coaches. The train operators or the government should have bought additional trains a long time ago. The government has placed an order for more trains only recently, and the first ones wont be delivered until next year. And when they do arrive I bet there wont be enough of them to solve the traffic problem. Are you in favor of the truck ban in Manila? Atienza, a former mayor of Manila, was asked. The cargo trucks should be rationalized, he replied. I did it myself when I was mayor. The huge trucks really contribute to the traffic jams. The truck operators and their business clients are blackmailing Mayor Joseph Estrada and Vice Mayor Isko Moreno by claiming that the truck ban causes the loss of billions of pesos because of the late deliveries of materials. But think of more billions of pesos lost to other businesses and ordinary citizens because of the traffic jams caused by the cargo trucks. Ships unloading cargo in the Port of Manila should be diverted to the ports in Batangas and Subic, Atienza said. The government spent billions of pesos for the Batangas port, but it is only 8 percent utilized. Most of the cargo unloaded in Manila are bound for the Calabarzon area (Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal and Quezon). Why not unload them in Batangas where they would be nearer to the recipients? Relieve the congestion in Manila by unloading cargo bound for southern Luzon in Batangas and those bound for northern provinces in Subic, Atienza added. * * * On the controversial Disbursement Acceleration Program (DAP), Osmea said those who wasted the funds in bogus nongovernment organizations should really be prosecuted. But those who spent the money on worthy and necessary projects should be applauded. He added that his DAP funds had been spent wisely on needed projects.",Neal H.

2014-07-18,,,,"MANILA - The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Friday said it will comply with the Court of Appeals (CA) order to lift the 6-month suspension order on G.V. Florida Transport Inc.'s 186 bus units. The LTFRB said it will start returning yellow plates to the bus company. Board personnel will supervise the re-attachment of the plates starting this weekend. LTFRB chairman Winston Ginez, however, said the Board will continue to seek the reversal of the CA decision. He said the Board has consulted the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) in appealing the decision before the Supreme Court (SC). The LTFRB suspended for 6 months the entire fleet of G.V. Florida last March after one of its units figured in a fatal road accident in Bontoc, Mountain Province in February 7. The accident claimed the lives of 15 passengers, including comedian Arvin ""Tado"" Jimenez, and left 32 others injured. Last month, the CA ordered the of the suspension order on Florida's 186 bus units covered by 28 Certificates of Public Convenience (CPC) found to be without any franchise violation. The appellate court said the LTFRB committed grave abuse of discretion in giving an ""illegal"" order ""without any factual and legal bases"" when it handed down the suspension order on the 28 CPCs ""in the absolute absence of a violation or wrong committed."" But it affirmed the cancellation of a CPC under the name ""Norberto M. Cue, Sr."" covering 10 buses under the ""beneficial ownership"" of Florida, which includes the bus unit that figured in the fatal Bontoc crash.

2014-07-23,,,,"MANILA - The Quezon City council has approved a measure requiring all persons riding motorcycles going through the city's roads to wear vests or any kind of sleeved clothing with the printed plate number of the motorcycles they are riding. There is an imperative need for the visible display of motorcycles plate number which can immediately be verified with the Land Transportation Office in case of involvement in criminal activity or vehicular accident, read the measure approved on third and final reading on Monday. Second district Councilor Ranulfo Ludovica, principal author of the measure, told The STAR that the city will only require vests for motorcycle riders with passengers and not for lone motorcycle riders. That was the compromise (with the motorcycle riders groups), he said in Filipino. Ludovica said they will not prescribe vest specifications to dispel allegations that the city will turn the ordinance into a money-making venture. ''What is important is that they follow the prescribed size of the letters, he said, noting that each letter or number has to be six inches in height and one inch in width. The measure has yet to be approved by Mayor Herbert Bautista. It was passed months after a deadly shooting spree in Fairview in May that left four people dead. The penalties are as follows: a fine of P1,000 or five hours of community service for the first offense; P2,000 fine or eight hours of community service for the second offense; and P5,000 fine, one years imprisonment or both for the third and succeeding offense.",,"By Janvic Mateo, The Philippine Star",City official,yes,2014-07-23 00:00:00,formulation of legislationlocal ordinances,,,,,,,,english,,http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/07/23/14/plate-number-vests-must-bikers-qc,,"quezon city, quezon",text,,406.0,,1994.0,,candice,,,policy and legislation,5.5,Straight News,,,,,,abs-cbnnews,no,no,,,,Plate number vests a must for bikers in QC,Neutral,,

2014-07-25,,,,"Motorists and commuters who have to pass through the North Luzon Expressway this weekend may have to take alternate routes as early as Friday evening, as members of the Iglesia Ni Cristo flock to Bulacan for their centennial celebration on Sunday.  Authorities expect some Iglesia Ni Cristo members to head for Ciudad de Victoria in Bulacan via NLEX as early as Friday evening, GMA News' Susan Enriquez reported on ""24 Oras.""  NLEX management expects 82,000, translated to at least a million people, to flock to the event.  MMDA Chairman Francis Tolentino on Friday conducted an aerial survey of the Philippine Arena at Ciudad de Victoria, where the centennial activity will be held on Sunday.  The Philippine Arena, considered the world's biggest indoor arena, has a capacity of some three million, the report said.  On the other hand, the MMDA set up an incident command center near the North Luzon Expressway. This included tents, rescue vehicles, and container vans.  The MMDA also readied closed-circuit television monitors to keep an eye on traffic flow.  ""God-willing, maayos naman ito,"" Tolentino said.  However, Tolentino said in an interview on GMA News TV's ""Quick Response Team"" that motorists and commuters who could afford to postpone their trips via NLEX this weekend may want to do so.        Some of the alternate routes include Mindanao Avenue instead of Balintawak Toll Plaza, though it may also become crowded.  Motorists were also urged to try passing through the smaller exits at NLEX.  For its part, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board said motorists can pass the inner and secondary roads in Bulacan and Valenzuela City.  These include roads in Malolos, Calumpit, Bocaue, Meycauayan, Marilao, Sta. Maria, Norzagaray and Valenzuela City, as well as Sta. Maria Tungkong Manga Road instead of Sta. Maria Bypass, and the Old Cagayan Valley Road.    Earlier, NLEX operator Tollways Management Corp.

Ingco was tagged as the man who slugged in the face a traffic enforcer of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority during a road rage incident in Quezon City recently. The PNP FEO said that Ingco owned a Glock 9 mm pistol and a high-powered Bushmaster rifle. A police source said the firearms had expired licenses. The source said Ingcos license for the Glock 9 mm pistol was approved in August 2009 and expired in June 2011. Meanwhile, license for the Bushmaster rifle was granted by the FEO in September 2010. It expired in June 2012. Part of the PNP FEOs program is the Oplan Katok, which aims to trace thousands of loose firearms in the county. Gun owners who had failed to renew their gun permits would be facing charges of illegal possession of firearms, police said.

2014-07-27,,,,"MANILA, Philippines  The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) on Sunday warned the public to brace for heavy traffic on Edsa after the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) allowed provincial buses to once again pass through the busy thoroughfare to get to their terminals in the metropolis. MMDA Chair Francis Tolentino, in an interview on the agencys weekly radio program, said that he was not consulted on the matter. I was not furnished [with] an official copy of the memorandum circular and was also [not] consulted prior to its release, he added. Tolentino was referring to the LTFRBs Memorandum Circular No. 10 Series of 2014 issued on July 9 which, according to the transport board, was part of the conduct of rationalization of routes of provincial public utility bus service. With that memorandum circular, they are allowing about 2,000 buses to again enter Metro Manila and add to the daily volume of vehicles coming in, he said. Tolentino said that had he known about the LTFRB order, he would have consulted first the Metro Manila Council, the MMDAs policy-making body composed of Metro mayors. He stressed that the LTFRBs move would make the traffic situation in the metropolis go from bad to worse, particularly with the ongoing road and infrastructure projects being conducted by the Department of Public Works and Highways. In July 2013, the MMDA barred around 900 Cavite- and Batangas-bound buses from entering Metro Manila. As a result, Metro-bound passengers had to get off at the Southwest Integrated Provincial Transport Terminal (SWIPTT) on Coastal Road in Paraaque City and take another ride to get to their destination. The SWIPTT was one of three integrated terminals for provincial buses ordered put up by President Aquino through Executive Order No. 67 Series of 2012, which envisioned a centralized, intermodal and integrated bus terminal system at the fringes of Metro Manila. Tolentino said the LTFRB decision disregarded the policy set by Aquino, pointing out that the Presidents decision is a high-policy statement which one agency cannot just change. He also questioned the LTFRBs decision to allow public utility vehicles to operate outside their approved routes for 120 days with the suspension of enforcement operations against out-of-line violations from June 19 to Oct. 17. He stressed, however, that he would be willing to discuss these concerns with the LTFRB in a dialogue. RELATED STORIES",Maricar B.

2014-07-27,,,,"Traffic is expected to come to a virtual standstill on Sunday (today) on all roads leading to Philippine Arena in Bocaue town, Bulacan province, the main site of the Iglesia ni Cristo (INC) centennial celebration, where an estimated 3 million of the churchs members are expected to congregate. As early as 7 a.m. on Saturday, traffic was already building up on MacArthur Highway, Valenzuela City, as vehicles from different parts of Metro Manilalargely bound for the INC eventwere on the citys major road, presumably to escape the heavier flow of traffic Sunday. Valenzuela City chief of police Senior Supt. Rhoderick Armamento said that around 8 a.m., 37 buses that shuttled people from Rizal to Malanday caused major traffic buildup. As of 5 p.m., he said 169 buses and public utility jeepneys were headed from the city to Bocaue. Armamento said authorities were expecting around 1,000 buses to be shuttling people from Marilao town to Valenzuela City and back until Sunday. Saturday evening, the North Luzon Expressway (NLEx) traffic system noted heavy traffic in Marilao and Bocaue and along the southbound lane of Mindanao Avenue right after the Bocaue toll plaza as a result of the influx of vehicles heading for Philippine Arena. Heavy traffic was also noted on the northbound lane from Valenzuela City, all the way to Bocaue. Moderate to heavy traffic was also observed along C5 southbound lane from Tandang Sora to Xavierville and along McArthur Highway. INC spokesperson Edwil Zabala told Agence France-Presse that the pace of the spread of Iglesia  has exploded, during a tour of the City of Victory complex, which houses the 55,000-seat indoor stadium, to promote the centenary. The INC event will showcase the religions success here and abroad in the giant complex especially built for the occasion. To control the expected vehicular congestion today, traffic management officer Maj. Artemio Delina said the traffic enforcers would be deployed 24/7. Valenzuela City public information officer Ahna Mejia said the city did not make any major preparation for the INC event, but the local traffic management in cooperation with the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) will be on the alert and on standby in case of a heavy downpour. As this developed, the MMDA warned motorists of heavy traffic along roads leading to Bulacan, especially NLEx. In an advisory, the MMDA advised the public to avoid using the roads designated as parking areas. Instead they can use inner or secondary roads, especially in Santa Maria, Plaridel, Bocaue and Calumpit towns. To avoid the Santa Maria bypass road, which is expected to have thousands of parked vehicles during the grand event, the MMDA said motorists could take the Santa Maria-San Jose Road heading to Manga. Old Cagayan Valley Road and Malolos Plaridel Road, on the other hand, can be used to avoid traffic along Doa Remedios Trinidad Highway. The MMDA said motorists planning to take the MacArthur Highway could instead use the Landicho-Sandico Road in Marilao, which leads to Saluysoy Road-Hulo Banga Road in Meycauayan town. The public was also reminded that the stretch of MacArthur Highway from Calumpit to Valenzuela City will be used as parking area of the INC members coming from different parts of the country, designated by region, as follows: Cordillera Autonomous Region: From Calumpit to Malolos Region 3: From Malolos to Tabang, Bulacan Metro Manila East (NCR): From Guiguinto town, Bulacan, to Tabang Region 1: From Bocaue to Guiguinto Metro Manila West (NCR): From Bocaue to Marilao (both sides) Region 2: From Bocaue to Marilao (both sides) Metro Manila North (NCR): From Marilao to Valenzuela City (both sides) The shoulder lanes of Doa Remedios Trinidad Highway will also be used as parking spaces from Tabang to San Rafael town, Bulacan, by attendees coming from Region 5 and NCR (Quezon City). Those coming from Region 4 will park their cars and buses from Balagtas to Bustos in Bulacan. The Santa Maria Bypass Road from Santa Maria to Norzagaray town, Bulacan, will be occupied by Metro Manila Central and Visayas Region attendees. The Mindanao Avenue Extension to Smart Connect Interchange will also be used by buses coming from Metro Manila South. Motorists were earlier warned by the MMDA to avoid the southbound and northbound lanes of NLEx from July 26 to 28, since an estimated 10,000 buses and 2,500 private cars are expected to flock to the area surrounding the Arena. In case of heavy traffic along NLEx, the MMDA said a zipper lane could be utilized by northbound vehicles to counterflow on the opposite lane. An Android application called the INC Sentenaryo was launched by the agency to update the public of the traffic situation along affected roads. Meanwhile, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board has imposed a three-day (July 26-28) truck ban on a portion of NLEx and several roads leading to Bulacan. Trucks will not be allowed to pass through NLEx from Balintawak toll gate to Angeles City Exit in Pampanga province and vice versa. These vehicles are also prohibited from MacArthur Highway, Cagayan Valley Road, from Santa Rita Exit and all provincial roads in Bulacan designated as parking areas. Trucks carrying perishable goods are exempted from the ban. MMDA chair Francis Tolentino said necessary traffic and security measures had been finalized to ensure peace and order during the event. An MMDA Joint Command Center has been set up in Marilao to monitor traffic along major thoroughfares and is on standby for any emergencies. Tolentino also gave his final instructions yesterday morning to the 2,000-strong Metro Manila Public Safety Legion, which was deployed to Bocaue to keep peace and order, implement a comprehensive traffic management plan and do a postactivity cleanup at the site. Based on the monitoring of the command center, some of the events attendees had already arrived at the venue as early as yesterday morning and more were coming by the hour.

""No, no. Hindi kami magkakilala,"" businessman Joseph Russel Ingco said in an interview with ABS-CBNnews.com. Ingco denied that he is a big-time , as claimed by Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) Chairman Francis Tolentino. He also denied that he is paying off motorists to talk about their run-ins with MMDA traffic enforcer Jorbe Adriatico. ""Hindi naman siguro magbabayad ka. Obvious naman na yung mga tinatanong ng tao at yung law student in-acknowledge naman niya na mayroong pagtatalo,"" he said. At least three other motorists have about Adriatico's abusive behavior. One female law student said the MMDA enforcer shouted and spat on the ground after she asked for help from Adriatico during a traffic incident last month. Adriatico, however, said it was the law student who and even ordered him to delete a video that he took of her cursing. Another motorist said Adriatico last February 27, 2013 and refused to apologize. She said she filed a formal complaint at the Office of MMDA Chairman Francis Tolentino but got no response. Adriatico has accused Ingco of punching him and along his Maserati after an altercation along Araneta Avenue in Quezon City. On the other hand, Ingco said it was Adriatico who him of a traffic violation and then shoved a camera phone in his face to take his video. He said he slapped the phone away, causing the MMDA enforcer to slap him and grab his shirt. In the interview, Ingco confirmed that he had a passenger in the car who witnessed the incident. He said the passenger, whom he refused to identify for now, would shed more light on the incident. Ingco said that after the traffic altercation, he went home and could not think straight especially after the MMDA suddenly issued a P100,000 for any information that would lead to his capture. ""Nanlalata ako. Normal lang siguro na tuliro ka. Ang bilis ng oras na yun tapos ang bilis din nung paglabas ng P100,000 na reward. Yun ding hapon na yun,"" he said.

2014-07-29,,,,"MANILA, Philippines  Residents of Paraaque City have been warned of heavier traffic on Sucat Road, also called Dr. A. Santos Avenue, starting this weekend as the 45-day repair and rehabilitation of the Sucat Interchange Bridge gets under way. The Department of Public Works and Highways said that it will be closing the east-bound lane of the bridge starting Saturday until Sept. 15. In a letter to Paraaque Mayor Edwin Olivarez, DPWH district engineer Wilfredo Mallari said the agency would conduct a dry run on Wednesday and close the east-bound lane of the bridge from Dr. A. Santos Avenue to the Muntinlupa side of the bridge. The bridge repair and road closure is expected to affect the entire stretch of Dr. A. Santos, which can be really bad even on ordinary days, as well as the East and West Service Roads of the South Luzon Expressway in both Paraaque and Muntinlupa. Olivarez, in a statement, said that the citys Traffic Management Office would also study and propose alternative routes for motorists and commuters who will be affected by the repair. We will also look into the possibility of imposing a truck ban and the possible implementation of a color coding scheme to reduce traffic volume in the affected routes to ease the burden on our commuters and motorists during the duration of the bridge repair, Olivarez added.

2014-12-02,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesThe Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) said on Monday that the case ofthe Maserati-driving businessman who allegedly punched Jorbe Adriatico last weekwas totally unrelated to that of a law student who claimed that the traffic constable treated her rudely when she asked him for help. No relation at all, MMDA Chairman Francis Tolentino told reporters as he added, I think the camp of the Maserati driver is [muddling] the issue by using a totally unrelated incident. Besides, Adriatico is not the accused here; they are just trying to destroy his credibility and character which is not allowed by the Supreme Court. According to him, Section 34 of Rule 130 of the Rules of Court states that evidence that one did or did not do a certain thing at one time is not admissible to prove that he did or did not do the same or a similar thing at another time Tolentino, however, said that the law student, who refused to be identified, was welcome to file a complaint against Adriatico and assured her that should she do so, an administrative hearing would be conducted on the matter. Meanwhile, the Firearms and Explosives Office (FEO) of the Philippine National Police said that Ingco has two registered firearms whose licenses have already expired. A check with the FEO showed that the businessman owned a Glock 9-mm pistol and a high-powered Bushmaster rifle. The 9-mm pistols license was approved in August 2009 and expired in June 2011 while the Bushmasters license was approved in September 2010 and expired in June 2012. In television interviews over the weekend, the law student claimed that last month, her car was hit by another vehicle while it was parked on Banawe Street in Quezon City. She said that when she asked Adriatico for help, he spoke to her rudely as he took a video of her reactions using his cell phone. In a statement, the MMDA said that it was actually the law student who got angry and swore at the traffic constable because he told her that they would have to wait for the owner of the other vehicle to show up.",Maricar Brizuela,"4:15 AM | Tuesday, December 2nd, 2014","Metropolitan Manila Development Authority, Supreme Court",yes,2014-12-02 00:00:00,road rage,,,,,,,,english,,http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/654011/mmda-maserati-driver-trying-to-muddle-issue,,"quezon, manila",text,#maserati,899.0,,1827.0,,pia,,,road rage,4.5,Straight News,,,,,,inquirer,yes,,,,,MMDA: Maserati driver trying to muddle issue | Inquirer News,,,

2014-12-03,,,,"MANILA - The lawyer of Maserati Ghibli driver Joseph Russel Ingco on Wednesday said traffic constable Jorbe Adriatico violated the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority's own regarding the taking of videos of traffic violators. Speaking to radio DZMM, Atty. Edgardo Padernal, Ingco's counsel, said MMDA resolution 10-20 series of 2010 stated that the resolution can only be used within six months. This means that the resolution had already expired in ""May expiration yun, automatically expired after 6 months. Dapat end of 2011 wala nang resolution,"" he said. He said Adriatico violated the first rule of the MMDA order by taking a video of Ingco even though no traffic violation was involved. He said the constable also violated Rule 3 against intrusive video recording when he shoved his camera phone at Ingco's face during their run-in last week. He also said that after taking the video, the MMDA enforcer cannot just stop the traffic violator and accuse him of a violation. He reiterated that Adriatico failed to even ask Ingco for his license. ""Hindi lahat nasunod. Barumbadong dinuldul ang cellphone sa mukha ni Russel. Lahat ng protocol na iiral hindi sinunod,"" he said. Padernal said Ingco could file charges against the constable either later this week or next week after getting a medical certificate. He rejected calls that Ingco take a lie-detector test, saying this is inadmissible in court. Instead, he said both Ingco and Adriatico should take psychiatric tests and anger management tests ""to see who is really hot-headed."" He said psychiatric test are admissible as evidence. The lawyer also said reports that Ingco's Maserati was unregistered should be answered by the dealer. ""Ang Maserati na ito ay nabili sa local dealer, hindi sa gray market. Obligasyon ng dealer na irehistro yung kotse. Lahat ng dokumento naibigay na para irehistro ng dealer yung kotse. Kung may violation, dapat yung dealer ang habulin,"" he said. Adriatico earlier accused Ingco of trying to make an illegal left turn at the corner of Quezon Avenue and Araneta Avenue before the latter changed his mind and made a U-turn. He also accused Ingco of cursing him, flashing a and trying to take his phone. He also accused the Maserati driver of punching him and breaking his nose while driving away from the site. In a separate interview, Ingco denied cursing the MMDA traffic enforcer, flashing the dirty finger at him or even trying to take his cellphone. He said that after he made the U-turn, Adriatico was already in the middle of the street and flagged him down. He said Adriatico told him: ""May video ka! May video ka!"" Ingco said he stopped his vehicle and rolled down his window to ask about his alleged violation since that was the right process. He said that when he shoved away the phone, Adriatico got mad and slapped him in the face. ""Hinampas niya ako sa mukha. Duon na ho nagsimula yun. Nagbubunuan na kami,"" he said, adding the Maserati was not moving during the altercation. He also said that Adriatico was trying to force him out of the vehicle. ""Sabi ko 'Bos, tama na.' Hanggang sa ginawa ko, unti-unti, inandar ko kasi gusto ko umalis siya sa akin. Kung mapapansin niyo, pumepreno rin iyon kasi nagpupula...Hindi siya bumibitaw,"" he said. Ingco said it is not possible that he was holding on to Adriatico while driving and at the same time punching the MMDA enforcer. He said that all throughout the altercation, it was Adriatico who held on to his shirt and would not let go. He said a video taken during the altercation showed that he was driving the car slowly in an effort to shake off the traffic enforcer.",,ABS-CBNnews.com,,yes,2014-12-03 00:00:00,road rage,,,,,,,,english,,http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/12/03/14/lawyer-questions-camcording-traffic-enforcers,,"manila, quezon",text,#maserati,365.0,,1267.0,,candice,,,road rage,5.5,-,,,,,,abs-cbnnews,yes,no,,,,Lawyer questions camcording traffic enforcer,Neutral,,

The Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) on Tuesday said it would be closing the eastbound lane of the bridge starting Saturday until Sept. 15. In a letter to Paraaque Mayor Edwin Olivarez, DPWH district engineer Wilfredo Mallari said the agency would also conduct a dry run Tuesday and close the eastbound lane of the bridge from Dr. A.

In a statement, Olivarez said the citys Traffic Management Office would also study and propose alternative routes for motorists and commuters who would be affected by the repairs. We will also look into the possibility of imposing a truck ban and a color-coding scheme to reduce traffic volume in the affected routes and ease the burden of our commuters and motorists for the duration of the bridge repair, the mayor added.

2014-07-31,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesThe Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) blamed the ill-fated outcome of a recent Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) order on trucks that caused severe traffic jams along C5-Katipunan road in Quezon City. Because of trucks plying C5 road near the streets fronting Ateneo de Manila University and Miriam College, motorists are caught in a traffic gridlock. MMDA chairman Francis Tolentino said in a statement that the congestion was after the LTFRB lifted the truck ban last July 25. Last June 27, the LTFRB issued a no apprehension policy to all trucks-for-hire with green plates which should be observed by the MMDA and Land Transportation Office. The advisory gave permit trucks to freely pass through C5 from June 28 until July 28 without getting apprehended by traffic enforcers.  The LTFRB policy, however, was extended until August 29, an MMDA officer, who requested anonymity for lack of authority to speak, told INQUIRER.net over the phone. The current move of the LTFRB will only exacerbate the already worse traffic situation in the metropolis, said Tolentino. He said the volume of trucks plying Katipunan Avenue, particularly in front of Ateneo Gate 3, increased by about 80 percent. The MMDA chair explained that the number of trucks traversing the said road ballooned into 14,380almost twice the number of trucks at 7, 959 that plied C-5 Katipunan at the same time last year when the ban on trucks was still in effect. Before the directive, trucks were prohibited to ply C5-Katipunan road from 6 a.m. until 10 a.m. and from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. Our records only justify that vehicular bottleneck along Katipunan Avenue is the adverse effect of the new truck issuance of the LTFRB, he added.

The LTO on Friday issued the resolution over Ingcos alleged violations for reckless driving, committing a crime in the process of apprehension and driving an unregistered vehicle, spokesman Jason Salvador said. Salvador said there was a fine of P10,000 for each of the three violations, on top of the cancellation of Ingcos license. But Ingcos lawyer, Edgar Padernal, said they were never given any notice or summons for a chance to explain his side of the case. Padernal said Ingco was never able to answer in person or in writing the complaint against him filed by the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA).

2014-07-31,,,,"MANILA  It's hard to imagine comic character Dr. Bruce Banner -- alter ego of the Hulk -- driving around Metro Manila where encounters between gun-toting and knife-wielding motorists can happen anytime. Following a road rage incident near the EDSA Santolan Flyover, TV Patrol asked social media users how hot-headed motorists can keep their calm when they encounter fellow drivers with anger management issues. Some netizens believe that highways are no place for hot-head motorists, especially those who are already having a bad day. Facebook user Teresita Rogelio Mayo said, ""Don't drive! Stay at home ka na lang."" ""Mag-commute ka na lang kung wala kang patience,"" said Christianne Paula Miguel. Facebook user Kuya Bee Abaya, meanwhile, said weapons just fuel angry drivers. ''Sa mga motoristang madaling mag-init ang ulo, huwag nang magdala ng baril. Kalmahin ang sarili kapag may pagkakamali ang isa,"" he said. Yanne Bajar said, ""Iwanan ang yabang sa bahay. Wag magmayabang sa kalye lalo kung madali ka din naman palang mapikon."" Songs may help calm you down. But not all songs as Romeo Baba was specific when he said, ""Maglagay ng headphones, kinig ng love song, para di mainit ang ulo."" Meanwhile, Dionisio Cabrera shared he was also once involved in a road rage incident, but he was able to manage it well. ""Kasi may baril din ako noonkabataan ko papero mas lalo akong mapagpigil sa init ng ulo. Umiiwas ako sa away. Napa-away nga akomas grabeoffensive ang kalaban ko. Pero nag slow down siya noong nag-sori ako sa kanya,"" he said. Offensive driver? Here's Frank Redona has to say, ""Frank M. Redona Always be a defensive driver! When there is an irate driver, do not look at him/her; avoid eye contact!"" Nothing beats a level-head talk, as Coney Cervantes puts it, ""Dapat wag unahin ang init ng ulo kc lahat naman nadadaan sa magandang usapan. Wala pang masasaktan di ba!? Kapag inuna mo 'yung init ng ulo mo you never know baka makahanap ka ng katapat mo. 'Wag niyong sayangin buhay niyo sa bagay na pwede namang pag usapan."" ""Mind-setting lang yan kasi di maayos ang problema kung away agad,"" Marben Corder added. Maybe Allan Gastones' advice would helpbut dont drive after. ""Chillax lang. Two bottle of San Mig Lite nga jan,"" he said. If talk won't solve matters, maybe drivers should try sports instead, according to Boogie Arienza. "" Mag-billiards na lang kayong dalawa. Masyadong high blood si sir na may baril,"" he said referring to the gun-toting driver in a viral video. Meanwhile, here are other suggestions from Twitter: Multimedia motoring personality James Deakin earlier said anonymity behind the wheel, lack of concern over public or personal safety, and weapons on board are just some elements that trigger a primal reaction like road rage. Deakin said motorists should always alert traffic enforcers.

Under the memorandum of agreement, the three organizations will be fulfilling different but related functions to ensure the convenience and safety of IT-BPO workers when they travel from work using public utility buses and vehicles, UV express vans, and taxis regulated by the Board. IT solution provider EACOMM will offer their Trip Barker, a community-based Trip Planner for Mass Transit Systems that allow users to share information through updates and reports. Through the Trip Barker system, IT-BPO workers can avoid crowded stations, heaby traffic and flooded streets by monitoring events in the metro in real-time. The BWAP-TUCP, for its part, will implement programs towards improved and sustained security of IT-BPO workers while on the road, as well as establish effective means of communication to provide workers a venue to raise complaints against erring PUBs/PUVs. LTFRB will continue to coordinate with other government agencies related to public transportation, and security and safety of the general public, particularly the IT-BPO workers. As mandated by the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC), we are to ensure the convenience and safety of the people when they travel the metropolis, hence this agreement is very timely and highly relevant to our road safety campaign, LTFRB chairman Winston Ginez said.

2014-07-31,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesThe Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board on Thursday denied that heavy traffic in Quezon City was being caused by a one-month no apprehension policy for trucks for hire from July 29 to Aug. 29. LTFRB chair Winston Ginez also defended the decision, saying this was to give operators more time given the crucial services they give transporting goods from the port area. This was only issued on July 29 so to blame the LTRB memo on the sudden increase we think this is stretching things too much. These trucks have already been on the road before the LTFRB had issued the memo, Ginez said. The Metro Manila Development Authority earlier pointed to LTFRBs no apprehension policy as the cause of the traffic gridlock on Katipunan Avenue. Many motorists have been complaining about the bottleneck especially along the stretch fronting Ateneo de Manila University and Miriam college. Ginez noted that the policy covered trucks with so-called green plates. The extension was to give them time to comply with the Boards franchising regulations before they can again operate on national roads. The policy was issued in connection with the Boards Memorandum Circular 2014-008 re Clarification in so far as TH Freight Truck Services in the Implementation of Joint Administration Order 2014-00. With a substantial number of applicants still yet to complete their application for PA, the business sectors and freight owners requested the Board to extend the No Apprehension Policy for another month.

Police invited two men being linked to an incident of a traffic row on Friday captured on video that has gone viral to come down to Quezon City Police Districts Station 4 to clear their names. This is so taxi driver Glen Remetio can identify which man pointed a gun at him at the height of the altercation on the Edsa-Santolan flyover. Senior Insp. Virgilio Carodan said the police already filed on behalf of Remetio complaints of physical injury, malicious mischief and grave threats against Primex Development Corp. secretary Karlvin Earnest Ang. Ang was positively identified by Remetio through pictures shown to him of Primex employees. Earlier, the plate number of the Mercedes Benz (KDP 313) car Ang was driving at the time of the accident was traced to the real estate company. But as the complaint against Ang was filed, a lawyer, Derrick Delegencia, alleged that it was his client, Bill Emerson Tan, who was the man in the video, and not Ang. Primex manager Robert de la Cruz said Tan was the son of a company director to whom the Mercedes Benz was issued. But on Thursday, Carodan stood pat on his offices decision to file the complaints against Ang. Carodan added that Tan has not yet been considered a suspect in the case. We will not make any changes in the complaint unless the complainant [Remetio] says so, the police official said. If theyre saying were wrong, then we will invite them [Ang and Tan] to face the taxi driver so he can identify which one is really the suspect, Carodan said. Neither Ang nor Tan has made a personal appearance at the Cubao police station as of this writing. Actually, he [Remetio] doesnt really want this to become a big issue. He just wants the suspect to face him, apologize, and pay for the damages, Carodan said.",Jaymee T.

2014-08-01,,,,"MANILA - The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) is appealing for a stop to the blame game, saying government agencies should instead focus on finding ways on how to resolve Metro Manila's traffic problems. The LTFRB's statement came after the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) said the Board's no apprehension policy for trucks-for-hire with green plates is causing in C5-Katipunan area. The LTFRB rebutted this and pointed out that trucks-for-hire with green plates have been plying the C5-Katipunan area and other streets of Metro Manila even before the Board implemented the no apprehension policy, which gives operators time to apply for a provisional authority to travel. It also noted that traffic in C5 and EDSA has already been ""horrendous"" even before the implementation of the Joint Administrative Order (JAO) and Memorandum Circulars (MC). Therefore, the observed heavy traffic in the area by the MMDA was not caused by the Board's new policies, it added. ""The implementation of the JAO for only more than a month should not be blamed for the terrible traffic situation in Metro Manila. The objectives of the JAO and our MCs are clear. It is to put order to PUVs in the streets to help ease traffic and definitely not to aggravate it,"" LTFRB chairman Winston Ginez said. Ginez also clarified that the Board's memo on trucks-for-hire did not lift the MMDA's truck ban, which means they did not allow the trucks to use C5 and Katipunan 24 hours a day. He said the MMDA can and should have apprehended the trucks which are violating its truck ban. The LTFRB extended the no apprehension policy until August 29 to allow trucks-for-hire with green plates to apply for their franchise and provisional permits. The Board said it only wants to address the concerns of truck operators on the possible delays of delivery of goods ""that could also potentially affect the prevailing prices of goods and commodities."" ""The LTFRB and LTO, under the orders and supervision of the DOTC, have been arduously fixing and eradicating the ill practices of the past that have plagued these agencies. It is precisely for this reason why we increased the fines under the JAO, to instill discipline among our PUV operators and their drivers,"" Ginez said. ""However, we have to understand the economic impact should we be unreasonable with their genuine concerns. The task is enormous. What is important here is that both parties are working together to once and for all fix and rationalize franchises and their respective routes and permits,"" he added. Ginez appealed to all stakeholders to work together and focus on improving the traffic situation in the metropolis. Under the JAO, colorum bus operators will be fined P1 million; truck and van operators, P200,000; sedan operators, P120,000; jeepney owners, P50,000; and motorcycle operators, P6,000.",,ABS-CBNnews.com,"Metropolitan Manila Development Authority, LTFRB",yes,2014-08-01 00:00:00,"reports on traffic congestion,truck ban,colorum trucks,colorum fines",,,,,,,,english,,http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/08/01/14/ltfrb-stop-blame-game-traffic-woes,,"metro manila, manila",text,,236.0,,2281.0,,mavie,,,"colorum, traffic congestion",6.0,-,,,,,,abs-cbnnews,no,,,,,LTFRB: Stop blame game in traffic woes,,,

2014-08-01,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesMotorists in Metro Manila are paying the price for the relaxed crackdown on unauthorized truckers, according to the head of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) who took a swipe Thursday at another government agency, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). MMDA Chair Francis Tolentino noted that traffic had gotten worse particularly on Katipunan Avenue in Quezon City all the way to C5 Road, mainly because of the LTFRBs current No-Apprehension Policy for trucks that have yet to comply with its franchising regulations. Katipunan, named after a revolutionary organization that rose up against Spanish colonial rule in the late 19th century, is perennially a heavy-traffic area, the daily crawl endured especially by those going to Ateneo de Manila University and Miriam College. Data released by the MMDA to the media showed that 14,380 trucks passed through Katipunan Avenue on July 25 alone, while there were only 7,959 on the same date last year. Our records (show) that the vehicular bottleneck along Katipunan Avenue is an adverse effect (of the LTFRB policy), Tolentino said. The current move of the LTFRB will only exacerbate the already worse traffic situation in the metropolis, especially now that trucks are among the major contributors to the traffic gridlock. He noted that the reprieve period, earlier observed from June 28 to July 28, was even extended by the LTFRB for another month, or up to Aug. 29. He said the MMDA and the Metro Manila mayors were still willing to discuss these concerns with the LTFRB. But in a statement, the LTFRB said the memo it issued extending the no-apprehension period was not tantamount to lifting the MMDA truck ban but a response to a clamor from the business sector and freight owners whose operations across the country could suffer. Trucks with green plates for hire are already plying the roads even before the release of the LTFRB memo which aims to weed out colorum trucks from the roads, the statement added. In an interview, LTFRB Chair Winston Ginez also countered: To blame the LTRFB memo for the sudden increase, we think, is stretching things too much. These trucks have already been on the road before the LTFRB issued the memo. Ginez reiterated that the no-apprehension policy was meant to give truck operators more time to comply, given the crucial services they render in transporting goods from the ports. He noted that the policy covered trucks with so-called green plates and that the extension would give them time to comply with the boards franchising regulations so they could again operate on national roads. It was not the first time that the MMDA and LTFRB appeared out of sync. Last week, the MMDA warned the public of traffic getting heavier on Edsa after the board reportedly allowed provincial buses to again pass through the highway to reach their terminals within the capital. Tolentino then said he was not consulted about the LTFRBs move which, according to him, added about 2,000 buses in one stroke to Edsas daily traffic volume.",,", | 3:38 AM | Friday, August 1st, 2014","LTO, LTFRB",yes,2014-08-01 00:00:00,"enforcement of existing lawsordinances,reports on traffic congestion,colorum fines,colorum trucks",,,,,"Boards no-apprehension policy for trucks slammed, defended",,,english,,http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/625376/katipunan-uprising-mmda-vs-ltfrb,,"quezon, metro manila, quezon city, manila",text,,827.0,,1284.0,,pia,,,"colorum, traffic enforcement and violations, traffic congestion",4.5,Straight News,,,,,,inquirer,no,,,,,Katipunan uprising: MMDA vs LTFRB | Inquirer News,,,

2014-08-03,,,,"MANILA, Philippines - The Metro Manila Council (MMC), composed of all the mayors of Metro Manila, urged the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) Friday to spare Metro Manila from its rationalization of provincial bus routes. The MMC also serves as the policy-making arm of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA). In a two-page resolution issued by the MMCs special traffic committee, the LTFRB was urged not only to exclude the metropolis from the bus routes rationalization but to also intensify its campaign against public utility vehicles going outside their prescribed routes. The resolution cited the recent studies conducted by the MMDA and the Department of Transportation and Communication (DOTC) showing that one of the effective methods of decongesting traffic in Metro Manila is to restrict public provincial buses (PPBs) from entering Metro Manila. The LTFRB earlier issued a memorandum circular that laid down the implementing guidelines on the conduct of the rationalization of provincial bus routes, particularly of buses plying routes between Metro Manila and the provinces in Southern Luzon. In addition, the MMC said the LTFRB did not consult concerned Metro Manila local government units and the MMDA prior to the issuance of the circular. The LTFRB earlier issued its guidelines for bus operators to modify authorized routes, in a bid to resolve mass-transport concerns regarding out-of-line vehicles and illegally operating or colorum public utility buses. LTFRB Chairman Winston Ginez earlier said his agency has issued the memorandum circular to rationalize the existing routes and to designate a specific number of units for routes that have the most passenger demand. In connection with this rationalization, no new certificates of public convenience will be issued to bus operators. Bus operators may modify their authorized routes to meet current and future passenger needs. They can petition to amend their authorized routes, depending on the passenger demand, he said. Under the LTFRB guidelines, bus operators must maintain their own terminals at the origin and destination points of their proposed modified routes. However, the MMC noted that Malacaang had approved on Feb. 21, 2012 the establishment of a multi-modal transport system by integrating mass transportation systems. The MMC added that in July last year, the Office of the President also issued Amendment Order 40, which provides for the creation of interim transport terminals to reduce pollution on EDSA and to decongest the Metros roads. The MMC said the MMDAs Southwest Integrated Public Transport Terminal became operational in August 2013 pursuant to AO 40. With the creation of the SWIPTT, provincial buses coming from the south, particularly Cavite, terminate their routes at the SWIPTT, which is located at the grounds of the former Coastal Mall in Paraaque City.",,"By Mike Frialde, The Philippine Star","Metropolitan Manila Development Authority, Metro Manila Council",yes,2014-08-03 00:00:00,"traffic congestion solutions,rationalization of provincial bus routes",,,,,,,,english,,http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/08/03/14/mayors-ask-ltfrb-dont-change-provincial-bus-routes,,"cavite, metro manila, manila",text,,89.0,,232.0,,mavie,,,"public transportation regulation, traffic congestion",7.0,Straight News,,,,,,abs-cbnnews,no,,,,,Mayors ask LTFRB: Don't change provincial bus routes,Neutral,,
2014-08-04,,,Government agencies,"MANILA - Senator Miriam Defensor Santiago is blaming the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) for monster traffic jams in Katipunan Avenue and parts of C5. In a statement, Santiago said she filed a resolution calling for a Senate investigation of recent LTFRB rulings that she said further caused traffic gridlocks in major thoroughfares. ""I'm calling for a Senate investigation on these LTFRB issuances because they prejudice public transport safety to benefit only a few. It seems that these issuances violate the Aquino administration's policies for economic development,"" Santiago said. The senator particularly singled out Memorandum Circular Numbers 2014-009, which suspended operations against colorum buses and out-of-line operations; and 2014-010, which allowed public utility buses (PUBs) to modify their routes and pass through major thoroughfares, such as EDSA, from 19 June 2014 to 17 October 2014. She said the suspension of operations against the out-of-line buses ""would only legalize and spur the proliferation of unauthorized vehicles, which is inimical to the countrys economic development."" Santiago said legalizing out-of-line routes violate existing laws on land transportation. It also defeats the purpose of the establishment of the Integrated Transport System to decongest traffic in Metro Manila, she added. The lawmaker also slammed LTFRBs Board Resolution No. 5, which extended the No Apprehension Policy of trucks-for-hire (TH) freight services with green plates from 29 July to 29 August.  She said this also caused more traffic congestion across the metropolis. ""LTFRB's logic escapes me. Allowing these trucks to ply our roads when they are still securing the necessary paperwork in the name of trade and commerce is a flimsy excuse. This is LTFRB failing in their basic regulatory functions,"" she said. Santiago alleged LTFRB only consulted the business sector and the trucking companies and not the motorists and commuters about the circulars. She also cited studies that the LTFRB's ""no apprehension policy"" increased travel time and decreased travel speed in both lanes in the Commonwealth Ave.-South Superhighway route. In the southbound lane, the routes travel time suffered a 73.6 percent increase, while the travel speed slowed to down 41 percent. The studies also found that, compared with data from June 2013, the LTFRB's ""no apprehension policy"" increased truck volume in Katipunan Avenue by 80.67 percent, C5-Bagong Ilog by 60.52 percent, and C5-McKinley Hills by 33.07 percent.

According to the July 17 appellate court decision, the DMTC appeal was ""premature"" as it has a similar appeal pending before the DOTC.

2014-08-05,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesMetro mayors, together with the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA), unanimously approved on Monday a resolution defying the recent memorandum circulars issued by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). In an emergency meeting in Makati, the MMDA and its policy-making body, the Metro Manila Council, said that local government units in the metropolis would, through Board Resolution No. 3, Series of 2014, start enforcing their respective traffic policies despite the LTFRBs no apprehension policy for colorum trucks and its order allowing provincial buses to once again pass through Edsa. The mayors warned truck operators to comply with the MMDAs truck ban while bus operators were told to strictly stick to their approved routes. MMDA Chair Francis Tolentino said that although they were continuously apprehending truck-ban violators, drivers have been using the LTFRBs memorandum circulars to get around the law. He noted that the multiple vehicle collision in Taguig City, which was caused by a cargo truck with green plates, would not have happened had the LTFRB not extended for a month the no-apprehension policy, also observed by the Land Transportation Office. On July 21, the transport board released Board Resolution No. 5, Series of 2014, which allowed all for-hire trucks with green plates to ply Metro roads outside the MMDAs truck-ban hours from July 29 to Aug. 29. The move, according to the LTFRB, was in response to a clamor from businessmen affected by the truck ban and a crackdown on colorum vehicles. This was on top of a memorandum allowing provincial buses to pass through Edsa to reach their terminals in Metro Manila, almost a year after they were barred from entering the metropolis.

2014-08-05,,dead:1,,"MANILA, PhilippinesA man was killed while several others were hurt after a 14-wheel truck weighed down by its cargo of sand rolled down a sloping portion of C5 Road in Taguig City and hit seven other vehicles on Monday morning. Marcos Dalida of the city governments Traffic Management Office said the accident happened on the southbound lane of the busy thoroughfare near Market! Market! at Bonifacio Global City around 4 a.m. The cargo truck with plate number UNE 539, Dalida said, ended up hitting seven vehicles following ita Toyota Innova with plate number NQM 407 driven by Raymond Castaeda; an Isuzu truck with plate number WSU 554 driven by Edwin Cruz Orsino; a Toyota Vios taxi with plate number UVY 860 whose driver has yet to be identified; a Hyundai Accent taxi with plate number UPP 876 driven by Jaime Lucernas Poroy; a Nissan Sentra taxi with plate number TSP 314 driven by Randy Maligo Cabrera; a Mitsubishi Mirage with plate number UOK 417 driven by Benedict Herbas; and an Elf truck with plate number TKN 521 driven by Joselito Marquez. Traffic investigator PO3 Ramil Erlanda said the cargo truck slammed into the seven vehicles with such force that it caused one of them, the Elf truck, to burst into flames. The fire trapped one of the Elfs passengers, Richard Parado, inside the vehicle, killing him, Erlanda said. He was unable to jump out after the 14-wheeler truck hit the Elf truck so he was burnt inside the vehicle, the traffic investigator explained. According to Erlanda, the cargo truck stopped only after it hit the side of the road, causing it to tilt and fall on its left side. He told the Inquirer that around 10 were injured, either passengers or drivers of the vehicles involved in the crash. Dalida, however, said they counted just four. [Those injured] included a passenger in one of the taxis, and the driver of the Mirage, among others, Erlanda said, adding that the victims, who were taken to the Ospital ng Makati, all sustained minor injuries. Initial reports failed to identify the driver of the cargo truck who escaped. Later in the day, Erlanda identified the driver as Larry Mirandilla, 38. According to the information provided by the owner of the cargo truck, Treasure Rock Movers Co., based in Laguna, Mirandilla was with two truck helpers, one of them identified as Jeric de Guzman. The other one, Erlanda said, has yet to be identified as he was a new employee and had no company records. Erlanda told the Inquirer that based on their investigation, the two helpers had tried to stop the cargo truck from sliding down the sloping road by putting stoppers behind its tires. But when that didnt work, (all three, including the driver) escaped, he said. According to Erlanda, the driver will face charges of reckless imprudence resulting in homicide and multiple physical injuries. The accident tied up traffic on three lanes of C5 Road, leaving only one lane open to vehicles. As a result, traffic backed up for hours in the area and spilled over to adjacent roads, leaving motorists stuck in their vehicles for hours. According to the traffic investigator, the delay in the clearing of vehicles involved in the accident was due to misinformation. The first responders, according to him, were Makati traffic enforcers. But after 30 minutes, Bonifacio Global City marshals came to us and said (the incident was under the jurisdiction of Taguig), Erlanda said. Archimedes Silvallana of the Taguig City governments Traffic Management Office said it took some time for the towing truck of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) used for clearing operations to arrive at the site. The call for the towing truck came late, he explained. The MMDA said that the area was cleared of all the vehicles involved in the crash at 10:28 a.m.",Kristine Felisse Mangunay,"4:37 AM | Tuesday, August 5th, 2014","Philippine National Police, Taguig City Traffic Management Office",yes,2014-08-05 00:00:00,road crashes,,8.0,4.0,"ridergroup: passenger; injury: minor; hospital: Ospital ng Makati; /

2014-08-05,,killed:5 hurt:2,,"MANILA, PhilippinesA five-year-old girl was killed while two other people were injured on Sunday night after they were hit by a 10-wheel fuel truck refilling gas pumps at a gasoline station in Pasig City. According to a witness, the driver of the truck, Junval Oriona Merene, told authorities that he failed to engage the vehicles hand brake while the air brake was not working. When Merene removed the piece of wood he had placed under one of the truck tires, the vehicle moved forward, crossed the road and rammed the eatery where the victims were. The driver was later mauled by bystanders who witnessed the accident. He was arrested and remains detained at the Pasig City Police Station where, case investigator PO3 Randy Tedera said, they were preparing to charge him with reckless imprudence resulting in homicide and physical injuries. Five-year-old Joeylyn Beraa, whose mother owned a nearby retail store, died on the spot due to head injuries. She was at the eatery to ask her neighbor, Danilo Bumagat, 41, to teach her to use the computer tablet her parents had just given her. The accident happened at 6:30 p.m. on Sunday on Dr. Sixto Antonio Avenue in Barangay Caniogan, Pasig City. The eatery owner, Nerissa Montefero, 66, suffered minor bruises while Bumagat sustained multiple fractures in his arms and legs. He remains confined at Rizal Medical Center where doctors were set to operate on his limbs. Montefero told the Inquirer that before the accident, she was drinking coffee and seated at a table beside Beraa and Bumagat. She said that she saw the truck crossing the road toward them. When it hit them, the table they were seated at toppled and they were pinned underneath, she added. She then lost consciousness. Jesus Valdez, a resident who witnessed the accident, told the Inquirer that the truck driver was filling up the gas pumps at the Metro Oil gasoline station. He added that he saw the driver remove a piece of wood he had placed in front of the vehicles tires when he saw that the fuel hose was too short to reach one of the gas pumps. The vehicle, however, started moving forward on its own. Valdez said the driver tried to climb into the truck to step on the brakes but could not open the door. The victims were taken by bystanders to separate hospitals. Beraa was brought to Immaculate Conception Hospital where she was pronounced dead on arrival. Her neighbor, Gina Delgado, 41, described the young girl as a sweet girl who loved to make loom bands. She even gave one to Montefero who had just celebrated her birthday, Delgado told the Inquirer. She added that the girls parents were about to get married and Beraa had asked them for cream-colored sandals because she was to be the flower girl at their wedding later this year. The girls father was away at the time of the accident while her mother was tending to their store nearby. She had left her daughter in Monteferos care because the young girl wanted to ask Bumagat to teach her how to use her new tablet.",Vanessa B.

2014-08-05,,,,"MANILA  Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) chairman Winston Ginez defended the board's policy to allow unregistered trucks to use the road. Speaking to radio dzMM, Ginez said a consultation with the business sector, which includes port operators, led the LTFRB to allow trucks-for-hire with no existing franchise to use the road while their applications with the LTFRB are being processed. The application for franchise for trucks-for-hire will end on August 29. In the meantime, trucks without franchises are given provisional authority to travel. Ginez said there is a need to grant these trucks franchise before the government finally implements a provision in the Joint Administrative Order 2014-1 of the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC). The JAO imposes a P200,000 fine for first-time offender colorum trucks, while a heftier fine of P1 million awaits colorum buses. Ginez said the ''no apprehension'' policy was crafted to ensure that the flow of goods will continue and ports will become less congested. In response to criticisms that the LTFRB memorandum has triggered traffic jams around the metro, Ginez said the LTFRB did not say that the trucks can already violate the ''truck ban'' policy of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA). He added that the trucks being blamed by the MMDA and Metro Manila mayors for the heavy traffic were already using the roads as colorum way before the LTFRB finally gave them the chance to apply for franchise. ''Ninety percent of our trucks are colorum, that is why this is the solution we found,'' he told dzMM. Ginez said about 29,000 trucks all over the country have applied for franchise. Ginez also defended the LTFRB's decision to rationalize the routes of provincial buses. He said the Memorandum Circular Numbers 2014-009, which suspended operations against colorum buses and out-of-line operations, gives bus firms the chance to legitimately allocate their bus units to routes where passenger demand is high. Ginez noted that some bus firms were forced to deploy buses to certain routes with heavy passenger demand even if the units are not allowed due to franchise restrictions. He said just like the no apprehension policy for trucks, the memorandum circular guarantees operators of out-of-line and colorum buses that they will not be apprehended and be slapped with a hefty fine of P1 million under the JAO. He said not giving the bus firms the chance to rationalize their routes may result in massive transport strikes in the future, as bus firms face the risk of being fined. Ginez also clarified that the LTFRB is not issuing new franchises for Metro Manila. He said the memorandum only involves the modification of the buses' routes.",,"By Dharel Placido, ABS-CBNnews.com",LTFRB,yes,2014-08-05 00:00:00,enforcement of existing lawsordinances,,,,,,,,english,,http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/08/05/14/ltfrb-chief-defends-truck-bus-policies,,"metro manila, manila",text,,435.0,,2590.0,,candice,,,traffic enforcement and violations,5.5,Straight News,,,,,improvement of traffic enforcement,abs-cbnnews,no,no,,,,"LTFRB chief defends truck, bus policies",Neutral,,
2014-08-06,,,,"MANILA, Philippines - Cabinet Secretary Jose Rene Almendras will meet with concerned Cabinet members this week to draw up a plan to solve the worsening traffic situation in Metro Manila. Speaking to reporters, Presidential Communications Operations Office Secretary Herminio Coloma Jr. said the meeting aims to get inputs from the different government agencies to find a course of action acceptable to all. Malacaang issued the statement following complaints against the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) following Mondays seven-hour bottleneck on C-5 Road resulting from a vehicular accident. Coloma asked the public and the media for more understanding as the two agencies are trying to solve a very complicated problem: easing and regulating or removing illegal public transportation from the streets. We have few roads in Metro Manila compared to the number of vehicles on the streets, he said in Filipino. These are two considerations that need to be studied thoroughly to find the best solution. Coloma said the national government knows the concern of the Metro Manila Council about the policy adopted by the LTFRB or MMDA to free the highways of traffic gridlock, he added. What is important is that both national and local governments are working towards improving the plight of Metro Manila commuters and motorists, and have their welfare as their primary consideration, he said.",,"By Delon Porcalla, The Philippine Star",Presidential Cabinet,yes,2014-08-06 00:00:00,reports on traffic congestion,,,,,,,,english,,http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/08/05/14/cabinet-tackles-metro-manila-traffic-woes,,"metro manila, manila",text,,37.0,,1755.0,,mavie,,,traffic congestion,8.0,Straight News,,,,,,abs-cbnnews,no,no,,,,Cabinet tackles Metro Manila traffic woes,Neutral,,
2014-08-06,,,,"MANILA  Manila Vice Mayor and city traffic czar Isko Moreno criticized Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) chief Winston Ginez for saying that local government units may be held liable for not honoring a provisional permit to travel given to ''colorum'' trucks. Speaking to ANC, Moreno said it is the job of LGUs to ensure the safety of their people. He argued that large trucks should not be allowed to pass through crowded places like the city of Manila, at least during the day, since they pose danger to the people. ''Ako po ay hindi naniniwala sa sinabi ni Chairman Ginez that we will be made liable. With all due respect, I challenge him. In Calalay vs William, wherein iyung mga kalesa ipinagbawal sa Maynila due to traffic nung panahon ng mga ninuno natin. The SC (Supreme Court) upheld it,'' Moreno told ANC's Headstart. ''The welfare of the people is the supreme law. Ginagampanan lang namin ang aming tungkulin."" The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) and Metro Manila mayors are criticizing the LTFRB over the latter's implementation of a ''no apprehension'' policy for colorum trucks which have yet to secure franchise from the government. The LTFRB gave these trucks provisional authority to travel while their applications for franchise are being processed, saying about 90% of trucks nationwide are actually colorum. The board said apprehending these trucks, through the Joint Administrative Order 2014-1 of the LTFRB, Land Transportation Office (LTO), and Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC), will greatly affect the delivery of goods. The JAO imposes a P200,000 fine for first-time offender colorum trucks, while a heftier fine of P1 million awaits colorum buses. In response to criticisms that the LTFRB memorandum has triggered traffic jams around the metro, Ginez said the LTFRB did not say that the trucks can already violate the ''truck ban'' policy of the MMDA. He added that the trucks being blamed by the MMDA and Metro Manila mayors for the heavy traffic were already using the roads as colorum way before the LTFRB finally gave them the chance to apply for franchise. Teddy Gervacio, president of the Integrated North Harbor Truckers Association, believes trucks should not be required to acquire franchise. Gervacio said the service being rendered by trucks is different to the one being given by public utility vehicles such as jeepneys, buses and cabs. He also dismissed the notion that colorum or green-plated trucks are more prone to accidents. He said even trucks with green plates have insurance. He warned that limiting the access of trucks to roads will damage the economy since this will affect the smooth flow of goods in and out of the country. He hopes for the government to immediately fix the problem because the peak season is drawing near. In an earlier interview, Ginez said about 29,000 trucks all over the country have applied for franchise. Gervacio, however, noted that some of these trucks already have pending applications with the LTFRB that have been languishing in the agency for years. Gervacio said another problem facing the truckers is the limited road space allotted for them in Manila. The truck ban is still being enforced in Manila's minor roads, but the city government, upon the request of the national government, has allowed truckers to pass through a single lane along Roxas Boulevard. Gervacio, however, said the dedicated lane for trucks did little to solve the congestion problem in Manila's ports. He said trucks are stuck on the single lane since those in front of them still have to drop or pick up shipments. Exiting the port is also another problem, he said. ''Iyung palabas na sana ay dapat makalabas agad, eh pipila pa rin sa papasok ng pier,'' he explained. ''What we ask is we be given a second lane, a passing-through lane. Iyung mga may karga na palabas ng Manila, ay huwag ng pumila kasama ng papasok sa pier.""

2014-08-06,,,Government agencies,"MANILA, PhilippinesDays after the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) went finger-pointing over the daily traffic jams on Katipunan Avenue, the police officer in charge of the Quezon City thoroughfare said the MMDA actually shared part of the blame. Quezon City Police District (QCPD) Traffic Sector 3 head Chief Insp. Erlito Trinidad Renegin said that while traffic jams had been a perennial problem on the national road, it got worse due to MMDA measures such as the opening of U-turn slots and the ban on trucks along Edsa. When I was assigned to the Quezon City police in 1997, Katipunan was still wide open. It became congested only when it started serving as an alternative route for trucks banned from plying Edsa, Renegin told the Inquirer on Tuesday. Renegin also blamed the U-turn slots that had been opened on Katipunan since the time of [MMDA] Chair Bayani Fernando and now force vehicles to take up to two lanes just to make a turn. Commuter jeepney drivers who disregard the proper loading or unloading bays on Katipunan add to the problem, he said. Earlier, MMDA Chair Francis Tolentino said the number of trucks taking Katipunan increased by more than 80 percent from last years figures due to the nonapprehension policy being implemented by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) for trucks yet to comply with its franchising requirements. But Renegin disputed this: I dont see any change in traffic on Katipunan (because of the LTFRB policy). He pointed out that the policy only applied to colorum or unregistered trucks for hire, not to trucks violating the MMDA truck ban and other traffic regulations. The truck ban is still in effect (here). The trucks still come out all at the same time and use the same routes, Renegin said. If they have traffic violations, we still apprehend them.",Jaymee T.

2014-08-07,,,,"MANILA - After many days of battling it out with the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) got Malacaang's nod to proceed with the apprehension of colorum trucks and buses plying the streets of Metro Manila. In a press briefing on Thursday, Secretary Herminio Coloma Jr. of the Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) announced that the decision was made after a meeting inside Malacaang. The meeting was attended by Trade and Industry Secretary Gregory Domingo, Transportation and Communications Secretary Joseph Emilio Abaya, Public Works Secretary Rogelio Singson, Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima, MMDA Chairman Francis Tolentino, LTFRB Chairman Winston Ginez and Philippine Ports Authority General Manager Juan Sta. Ana. ""Ang mga sumusunod na hakbang ay napagkasunduan hinggil sa operasyon ng mga pampasaherong bus: ""Una, paghuli at pagpapamulta sa mga kolorum at out-of-line na bus sa EDSA at sa buong Metro Manila; at, ""ikalawa, patuloy na pag-rationalize batay sa masusing pag-aaral ng mga ruta ng provincial at city buses na bumibiyahe sa Metro Manila na isinasagawa ng LTFRB sa pakikipag-ugnayan sa MMDA,"" said Coloma. This consensus was reached after the meeting between agencies that was called on the directive of President Benigno Aquino III. The consensus virtually clamped down LTFRB Memorandum Circulars 2014-009 and 2014-010, which stop traffic law enforcers' operations against colorum public utility buses (PUBs) and allow PUBs to change their routes and pass through the metro's major roads, respectively. The LTFRB also drew the ire of metro mayors for extending the no apprehension policy for trucks-for-hire to allow those with green plates to operate, even as they await their franchise and provisional permits. ""Ang mga may-ari ng trak na gumagamit ng green plate ay maaari pang mag-apply para sa provisional authority (PA) hanggang ika-15 ng Agosto 2014. Simula sa ika-16 ng Agosto 2014, ang mga trucks-for-hire na walang provisional authority ay huhulihin at pagmumultahin,"" Coloma said. Coloma explained that green-plated trucks privately owned by individuals for their own business or those that are labeled ""not-for-hire"" will be required to apply for exemption from LTFRB. The exemption, which has a validity of three years and is renewable, will be issued for free until the next three months. That's additional task for the LTFRB and they don't get to charge truck owners for service fees for the exemption. The LTFRB's Circular is also inutile now on the truck ban. Malacaang said the exemption does not cover truck ban. ""Ang pagkakaloob ng PA o exemption ng mga green-plated ay hindi nangangahulugan na sila ay hindi na sakop ng truck ban at mga umiiral na batas trapiko. Kailangan pa rin po silang sumunod sa mga probisyon ng truck ban at ng mga batas trapiko,"" said Coloma. Effectively, the consensus reached in the Malacaang meeting took the side of the Manila City government which imposed a truck ban through the powers of a city ordinance. Vice Mayor Isko Moreno, the traffic czar of the City of Manila, has been very vocal in the past few days about his opposition to the LTFRB Circular. ""Nananawagan ang pamahalaan sa lahat ng port users na magsagawa ng regular na operasyon kahit na araw ng Linggo upang higit na mapabilis ang paglalabas ng mga kargamento mula sa pantalan ng Maynila. Patuloy ang pakikipag-ugnayan sa mga lokal na pamahalaan upang maibsan ang suliranin ng congestion sa Port of Manila at sa mga lansangan,"" Coloma said. He said Domingo, Abaya and Sta. Ana have reported in the meeting that steps are being done to ensure the implementation of the agreements reached between port users. Malacaang is expecting resumption of normal port operations by August 16.

2014-08-07,,,,"MANILA  A commuters' group is supporting the policy of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) suspending the operations of out-of-line buses. Elvira Medina, president of the National Center for Commuter Safety and Protection, said the LTFRB policy on the rationalization of routes of provincial buses is reasonable because it will help bus firms reach areas with high passenger demand. LTFRB's Memorandum Circular Numbers 2014-009 suspended operations against colorum buses and out-of-line operations. ''Hayaan na muna na natin, pagbigyan natin, lead time lang naman iyan. Wala pang isang buwan, kulang iyan para pagbigyan natin. Pagkatapos po, tsaka natin tignan ang effectiveness,'' Medina told dzMM. In an earlier interview, LTFRB chairman Winston Ginez said the memorandum gives bus firms the chance to legitimately allocate their bus units to routes where passenger demand is high. Ginez noted that some bus firms were forced to deploy buses to certain routes with heavy passenger demand even if the units are not allowed due to franchise restrictions. He said the memorandum circular guarantees drivers and operators of out-of-line and colorum buses that they will not be apprehended and be slapped with a hefty fine of P1 million under the Joint Administrative Order 2014-1 of the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC). Ginez said not giving the bus firms the chance to rationalize their routes may result in massive transport strikes in the future, as bus firms face the risk of being fined. He also clarified that the LTFRB is not issuing new franchises for Metro Manila. He said the memorandum only involves the modification of the buses' routes.

Coloma further said that government officials also agreed during the meeting to give trucks-for-hire still using green plates until August 15 to apply for provisional authority before the LTFRB.  Trucks without such authority will be apprehended and fined, he added.  The Palace official also said that privately owned, not-for-hire-trucks may meanwhile apply for a three-year exemption to the required provisional authority.  ""For the next three months, the government shall give the exemption for free. Despite the issuance of provisional authority or exemption, green-plated trucks will continue to be covered by the existing truck ban and other traffic regulations,"" he said.  Coloma said these decisions were reached to help decongest the Port of Manila.

2014-08-08,,,,"Whats happening to the directors of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB)? Are they blind, or do they see only peso signs? Dont they see the daily traffic gridlock not only on Edsa and C-5 but all over Metro Manila? The reason can be seen by anybody with common sense: too many vehicles on too few roads. We should reduce, not add to, the number of vehicles on the streets. But what is the LTFRB doing? It is allowing trucks and buses without franchises to use Metro Manilas streets, anywhere they want, with no risk of being apprehended. As expected, the result is bedlammotorists stuck in unmoving traffic for hours and losing precious time and opportunities. The LTFRBs alleged excuse for its no apprehension policy is to give the operators time to complete the documents needed for new franchises. What, it will award more franchises when, clearly, there is no more room on the streets for more vehicles? What it should be doing is cancel franchises, not issue more of them. Metro Manila is bursting at the seams. There is no more room to move around. It is becoming one huge parking lot. The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) and its mayors are understandably angry over this latest boo-boo of the LTFRB. They have warned truck and bus operators that drivers of colorum or out-of-line vehicles would be arrested notwithstanding the permits given them by the LTFRB. You know what the LTFRB advised the drivers and operators to do if they are arrested? Take the local government units to court. Thats the type of officials we have at the LTFRB. The LTFRB has also allowed provincial buses to enter the inner cities. Provincial buses should stay in the provinces. They should stop at the city limits and not add to the traffic jams inside. And yet the provinces need the buses very badly. Farmers often wait for hours for transportation to take their produce to market. Schoolchildren have to walk many kilometers to go to school because there is no transportation. Provincial folk would be very grateful to have more buses. But why do the bus operators insist on plying their route in Metro Manila, where they have fewer passengers and they have less trips because of the traffic jams, and where they operate as colorum vehicles? They must be making more money there. The LTFRB should be issuing franchises to more bus operators to ply their routes in the provinces. But money speaks louder than common sense. President Aquino should change the top officials of the LTFRB to bring sanity to our streets. We do not need transportation officials such as what we have now at the LTFRB. Instead of looking for ways to ease the traffic jams, they are exacerbating them. Its said that the LTFRB has been a den of corruption since it was first established as the Public Service Commission. The PSC then was full of fixers. Its said that you could get anything from the PSC if the price is rightand that includes a franchise. Thus, we now have a surfeit of buses running half-empty even during rush hours and wasting precious fuel and polluting the air with their exhausts. And many of them are not roadworthy and driven by unqualified drivers, which result in accidents that take the lives of their passengers. I invite LTFRB officials to get out of their air-conditioned offices, stand on the sidewalks of Edsa and watch the buses crawling bumper to bumper with very few passengers even during rush hours. There are just too many of them. Now the LTFRB wants to add more buses and trucks on the streets. Why? How many millions of reasons do they have for such a decision? How do the bus companies survive with so few passengers? They must be overcharging their few passengers. These passengers are paying for all the empty seats. Who fixes the passenger fares? The LTFRB. If the buses were not overcharging their passengers, they would have gone bankrupt a long time ago. But obviously they are making more money in Metro Manila even with few passengers. The elevated train lines were intended to put the buses out of business because even then, they were already taking too much road space and contributing to the traffic jams. Commuters were expected to take public transportation and leave their cars at home. In fact, having huge parking lots for private cars at every train station was among the original plans, but that was not followed by the concessionaires. The concessionaires, with only profit in mind, did not provide for enough trains and coaches. Now we have long lines of commuters waiting to get into the already packed trains. In self-defense, commuters, or at least those who have the means, buy carsand these add more vehicles on the streets that cause traffic jams. Every year, 300 new cars are poured onto the streets by the car assemblers, but old ones are not being phased out. Where will we put all those vehicles?",Neal H.

2014-08-08,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesMalacaang stepped into the conflict between two government agencies that regulate trucking operations in the capital, announcing at least one concrete step on Thursday to resolve the clashing positions of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). A Palace meeting between the two agencies ended in an agreement to shorten the reprieve period that the LTFRB earlier granted to colorum or unauthorized cargo haulers and those listed as private vehicles bearing green license plates. Colorum and green-plated truck operators have only up to Aug. 15not Aug. 29to secure a provisional authority from the LTFRB, Communications Secretary Herminio Coloma said in a press briefing. The new deadline drastically reduced the time frame for the LTFRBs no-apprehension policy, which the board first set as a one-month window period (from June 28 to July 28) and then extended for another month (July 29 to Aug. 29). The extension drew criticism from MMDA Chair Francis Tolentino, who last week blamed the policy for the worsening traffic situation across the metropolis. Earlier, he also assailed the boards decision allowing provincial buses to again pass through Edsa. Tolentino particularly reported an 80-percent increase in the number of trucks plying Katipunan Avenue in Quezon City. Metro Manila mayors later sided with the MMDA and issued a joint resolution saying their local traffic marshals would still go after colorum trucks, even those brandishing the LTFRB provisional authority. LTRFB Chair Winston Ginez earlier defended the policy, saying it was in response to clamors from the business sector whose cargo haulers are struggling to cope with the Metro-wide truck banparticularly the one enforced in the City of Manilaand whose trucks have yet to meet franchising requirements. Coloma faced reporters to disclose the results of Thursdays meeting between the LTFRB and the MMDA in Malacaang. Effective Aug. 16, 2014, trucks without provisional authority will be apprehended and fined, he said. Meanwhile, not-for-hire trucks owned by private individuals or organizations for their own use may apply for exemption from (this) requirement. In an interview after the meeting, Ginez said his agency would comply with the Palace directive that the no-apprehension policy for trucks-for-hire or those using green plates would end on Aug. 15. After that date, those who will operate without the provisional authority risk being fined P200,000, he added. But Ginez continued to explain the policy, saying it was actually upheld in the Palace meeting. The provisional authority does not exempt (trucks) from the ban enforced by the MMDA. They should still observe the truck ban. So we (LTFRB) were the ones who were upheld. Ginez disclosed that the board had received 30,000 applications for provisional authority since the policy took effect. Coloma also said the meeting also tackled the unusual delay in the movement of cargo out of the ports in Manila due to the expanded truck ban enforced by the city government since February under Mayor Joseph Estrada. We have to understand that the truck ban created constraints in logistics flow from the Port of Manila, he said. But were now looking for solutions and our level of confidence is high that the situation would go back to normal by the middle of the month. But the Palace official did not give specifics as to how port operations would go back to normal, and merely said port users should have regular operations even on Sundays to further expedite the release of cargoes from the Port of Manila. Coloma said the meeting did not touch on the possibility of President Aquino stepping in to lift or ease the truck ban.

2014-08-11,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesA total of 53 public utility vehicles (PUVs) found operating outside their designated routes or without a valid transport franchise have been impounded by the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA). The out-of-line and colorum vehicles were apprehended in the first three days of the agencys campaign dubbed Oplan Disiplina aimed at easing traffic flow on Edsa and other major thoroughfares. The crackdown kicked off on Aug. 6, two days after the agency and its policy-making bodythe Metro Manila Council composed of the 17 mayors in the metropolisannounced in a resolution their intention to enforce their respective traffic regulations despite the recent memorandum circulars issued by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). In particular, they criticized the LTFRB for its no apprehension policy toward colorum trucks effective from July 29 to Aug. 29 and its order allowing provincial buses to once again pass though Edsa to get to their terminals in the metropolis. Following a meeting in Malacaang last week, the MMDA and LTFRB agreed that the owners of unauthorized cargo trucks would have until Aug. 15 only instead of Aug. 29 to secure a provisional authority from the transport board. Those without the required document would be apprehended and penalized, they also announced. In an interview during the agencys Sunday radio program, MMDA Traffic Discipline Office officer-in-charge Cris Saruca said that of the 53 impounded vehicles, two were colorum Asian Utility Vehicles while the rest were passenger buses that were either operating outside their designated route or without a valid franchise. According to Saruca, the owners of the impounded vehicles were fined P6,000 each while their drivers would be banned from driving for a week. During the first day of the implementation of Oplan Disiplina last Wednesday, MMDA traffic enforcers led by Chair Francis Tolentino caught 12 out-of-line and 3 colorum buses on Edsa Balintawak and in the White Plains area in Quezon City, he added. The following day, 15 out-of-line buses from Cavite, Batangas and Pangasinan provinces were apprehended on Edsa southbound corner Roxas Boulevard. Saruca said these buses were not allowed to pass through Edsa and should have dropped off all their passengers at the South-West Integrated Provincial Transport Terminal in Paraaque City. During the third day of Oplan Disiplina, we were able to apprehend only seven out-of-line buses, he reported, noting the drop in the number of errant bus firms due to the agencys crackdown. At the same time, Saruca warned that the MMDA would continue to go after colorum and out-of-line public utility vehicles this week.",Maricar B.

2014-08-11,,,,"MANILA, Philippines  To ease the heavy traffic gridlock along Quezon Avenue in Quezon City, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) has reactivated traffic signals in three areas, replacing closed U-turn slots. During the agencys weekly radio program, MMDA Traffic Engineering Center Head Noemi Recio said that they have activated traffic lights at three opened intersections along Quezon Avenue. We have reactivated signal lights on Banawe, Roosevelt and Timog-West Avenue but these traffic lights will still be placed under evaluation, Recio said, adding that the MMDA has observed that these signal lights have helped ease the traffic situation with proper enforcement. Recio noted that motorists plying the busy thoroughfare have been complaining of the heavy traffic along Quezon Avenue but would sometimes blame it on the traffic signals in the area. Based on our monitoring, the traffic buildup in the area is not caused by the reactivated traffic lights but by illegally parked vehicles, jeepney and tricycle terminals, and sometimes vehicular accidents, Recio explained. Cris Saruca, officer-in-charge of the MMDA Traffic Discipline Office, also said during the MMDA radio program that they would preposition tow trucks and roving traffic personnel to apprehend illegally parked vehicles in the area. In an earlier interview with the Philippine Daily Inquirer, Saruca noted that the MMDA has been planning to reactivate traffic lights along Katipunan Avenue to also replace the U-turn slots which they would like to close. A Quezon City traffic head earlier shared with the Philippine Daily Inquirer his observation that the U-turn slots along Katipunan added to the traffic jam in the area as trucks and other vehicles plying the road would have to take about two lanes to make a turn.

Jonathan de la Cruz assailed LTFRB chairman Winston Ginez for issuing memorandum circulars (MC) 2014-009 and 2014-010 as part of the agencys rationalization plan. The first MC prohibits traffic law enforcers from apprehending colorum public utility buses while the latter allows PUBs to change their routes at will and pass through major roads of Metro Manila, they said. Ginez faced lawmakers during a hearing on Monday conducted by the committee on Metro Manila development chaired by Quezon City Rep. Winston Castelo. Dela Cruz said the LTFRB has no study to measure route capacities except perhaps the one plying EDSA from Monumento in Caloocan City to Baclaran in Pasay City. He said under the MCs, bus companies who have colorum units or have no franchises at all will be given franchises, and will also be allowed to choose their own routes without any regard to their adverse impact on traffic and environment. The MCs were issued only in consultation with bus companies, he said, and the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority and mayors were not consulted. He said Ginez appears to be influenced by bus companies, particularly Solid North and JAC Liner. He said the two companies have been operating on unclear franchises and have been involved in numerous accidents. Atienza scored Ginez for worsening the traffic congestion in Metro Manila despite several recommendations from local and international agencies. He cited the studies conducted by the Japan International Cooperation Agency, the University of the Philippines National Center for Transportation Studies and The World Bank, which revealed that the number of buses on EDSA can be reduced by as much as 50 percent without sacrificing the needs of the public. Ginez said the LTFRB is still studying the matter. Valenzuela City Rep. Sherwin Gatchalian and Sen. Miriam Santiago had earlier questioned the legality of the circulars.",,"By Paolo Romero, The Philippine Star","LTFRB, Buhay Partylist, Abakada Partylist",yes,2014-08-13 00:00:00,"enforcement of existing lawsordinances,ltfrb on colorum buses",,,,,,,,english,,http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/08/12/14/lawmakers-ltfrb-favors-certain-bus-firms,,"caloocan, santiago, metro manila, quezon city, valenzuela, manila, quezon, pasay",text,,69.0,,1819.0,,mavie,,,"colorum, traffic enforcement and violations",7.0,Straight News,,,,,,abs-cbnnews,no,,,,,Lawmakers: LTFRB favors certain bus firms,Neutral,,

2014-10-02,,,Public officials,"CEBU CITYAt least 300 jeepney drivers stopped plying their routes on Tuesday in what they said was a protest action, not a strike meant to paralyze transportation in the city, against excessive traffic violation penalties. Greg Perez, head of the militant Pinagisang Samahan ng mga Tsuper at Operator Nationwide (Piston) in Cebu, said the protest action was not meant to paralyze transportation. We only wanted to voice out our grievances, he said. The drivers are protesting a joint administrative order of two agenciesLand Transportation Office (LTO) and Land Transportation Franchising Regulatory Board (LTFRB)that increased penalties for operators of unregistered public utility vehicles. Owners of so-called colorum PUVs face fines of as much as P1 million for buses and P50,000 for jeepneys. The order also imposes fines and penalties for other violations like refusal to convey passengers to their destinations, arrogance toward passengers, use of vehicles with defective parts, cutting trips and use of tampered taxi meters. Anticipating transport paralysis, the local government units of Cebu and Mandaue sent out government vehicles to ferry stranded passengers. Dr. Rhea Mar Angtud, head of Cebu Citys Schools Division, also ordered classes cut short in public elementary and high schools until 3 p.m. to prevent pupils and students from being stranded on the streets.

2014-08-14,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesManilas City Hall is casting its anticolorum net wider on the citys main streets to cover both big fish and small fry in an effort to ease vehicular traffic. After going after trucks and buses, city officials on Wednesday shifted their campaign against vehicles operating illegally to check on public utility vans and jeepneys. Vice Mayor Francisco Isko Moreno Domagoso led officials from the Manila Traffic and Parking Bureau (MTPB) and Manila traffic police in flagging down white vans marked UV Express along Taft Avenue in front of City Hall as early as 8 a.m. Most of the vans and FX vehicles had green plates instead of the prescribed yellow plates designated for public utility vehicles (PUVs). The drivers were asked to present original copies of vehicle registration and franchise papers. Vehicles with green plates but whose franchise documents were verified to be complete and up-to-date were allowed to leave. Confirmed colorum vehicles were held for a trip to an impounding lot. Their operators will be directed to the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) and pay the appropriate fines. Only 12 of the 70 PUVs inspected were found to be operating illegally. Its a hassle for the drivers, passengers, and for us as well, but we are doing this to show that this is serious business. We cant be defeated by the tedious process [of inspecting PUVs], Moreno said. However, I am asking LTRFB to please issue already yellow plates to those with legal franchises. The inspection and verification of documents lasted till around midday. Passengers of the affected vans had to alight and transfer to other vehicles. This is going to be a massive operation. Metro Manila mayors and other agencies have declared an all-out war against colorum, Moreno said. Even if, say, you go through Pasay without getting caught, you will eventually be apprehended in Manila. Colorum vehicles cannot hide anymore. On Tuesday, the Metro Manila Council, composed of the different mayors, agreed to uphold the joint administrative order issued by the LTFRB, Land Transportation Office and the Department of Transportation and Communications, which imposes fines for colorum vehicles amounting to P1 million for buses, P200,000 for trucks and vans, P50,000 for jeeps and P120,000 for cars.",Annelle Tayao-Juego,"4:31 AM | Thursday, August 14th, 2014",City Government of Manila,yes,2014-08-14 00:00:00,"enforcement of existing lawsordinances,colorum fines,puv fines",,,,,,,,english,,http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/629079/manila-renews-drive-vs-colorum-vans-jeeps,,"metro manila, manila, pasay",text,,179.0,,414.0,,mavie,,,"colorum, traffic enforcement and violations",6.5,Straight News,,,,,,inquirer,no,,,,,"Manila renews drive vs colorum vans, jeeps | Inquirer News",Neutral,,

2014-08-15,,,,"MANILA, Philippines - The worsening traffic situation in Metro Manila can be attributed to too many public utility vehicles (PUVs) in the metropolis, Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) chair Winston Ginez said in a roundtable discussion with STAR editors and reporters Wednesday night. He said the traffic gridlocks are caused by among other factors, the volume of city buses being more than double what EDSA can accommodate, provincial jeepneys invading the metropolis and the actual volume of trucks-for-hire being thrice the number of those that have franchises. Ginez said this has been the situation for decades that now needs to be addressed with modernization policies, including the eventual phaseout of old vehicles and the rationalization of bus routes. He cited that at present, some 3,500 city buses  all of them with franchises  ply EDSA everyday. But according to studies, EDSA can only accommodate 1,600, Ginez said. Adding to this is the problem of out-of-line provincial buses, whose operators assign certain units to other existing franchise routes without approval of the board. At present, the board is spearheading the rationalization of provincial buses, a move that recently drew flak from Metro Manila mayors and the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA). The board will now study the applications, the deadline for filing of which is today, before deciding whether to allow them. According to Ginez, there are now around 60,000 public utility jeepneys in Metro Manila. He said these are not colorum jeepneys, as they have certificates of public convenience or franchises. However, a number of these are not Metro Manila jeepneys and hold franchises issued in the provinces. While these could not be considered colorum operations, these provincial jeepneys in Metro Manila fall under the so-called out-of-line vehicles. These are holders of franchises issued in other regions (outside Metro Manila) but the units have been brought here in the Metro, Ginez said. According to Ginez, this problem will be addressed with the Land Transportation Office (LTO) license plate standardization project, which is being implemented. Under the program, the yellow plates issued to public utility vehicles, including jeepneys, would include not just the plate number but also the region where the plates were issued. Another issue that caused the board to draw flak is when the LTFRB gave trucks-for-hire more time to apply for franchises and temporarily exempted them from apprehension, the fines for which have increased under the new rules issued by the LTFRB and the LTO. Metro Manila mayors and the MMDA accused the LTFRBs move of supposedly having caused traffic situation in the metropolis to worsen. According to Ginez, there were 11,000 authorized trucks-for-hire before the joint administrative order imposing higher fines for violations, including colorum operation, was issued. But Ginez said there were trucks other than these 11,000 vehicles that were being rented out by their operators, and thus, should have been carrying yellow plates and the subject of franchises. With the leeway issued by the board, some 32,000 more trucks have applied from June 16 to Aug. 8. The board has until Oct. 17 to resolve these applications for franchises, as the provisional authority given to these trucks would no longer be honored by then.",,"By Reinir Padua, The Philippine Star",LTFRB,yes,2014-08-15 00:00:00,reports on traffic congestion,,,,,,,,english,,http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/08/14/14/ltfrb-too-many-legal-puvs-metro-manila,,"metro manila, manila",text,,588.0,,1894.0,,candice,,,traffic congestion,5.0,Straight News,,,,,stricter public transport franchise regulation,abs-cbnnews,no,no,,,,LTFRB: Too many 'legal' PUVs in Metro Manila,Neutral,,

2014-08-16,,,," MANILA - The Train Riders Network (TREN) is demanding the resignation of Transportation Secretary Jun Abaya following the derailment of a Metro Rail Transit (MRT) train that left over 30 people injured last Wednesday. In a statement on Saturday, TREN spokesperson James Relativo criticized Abaya for allegedly being preoccupied with the upcoming 2016 elections instead of focusing on the country's public mass transport system. Abaya is the president of the Liberal Party (LP). ""Abaya is always busy for the 2016 elections while grossly negligent on the task of ensuring that the MRT and the public mass transport system are reliable and safe. If Abaya does not have the delicadeza, we call on President Aquino to fire him,"" Relativo said. He said aside from accountability, their group is also demanding change in the MRT system. ""While we can no longer change the fact that the MRT's original design and size do not fit the needs and potential of Metro Manila commuters, we could mitigate this through excellent management, regular maintenance and bold plans for expansion and improvement."" ""None of that has happened. MRT (mis)management is controlled by private contractors, even as it is the President who appoints the general manager and taxpayer money of up to P5-billion has been spent annually to pay the debts of the stupidest private sector-led train management this side of the world,"" he said. Relativo stressed that the change they are demanding does not include any fare hike. He said the problems in the MRT system would not be solved by a fare hike. ""A fare hike would be like rewarding the grossly incompetent, taxpayer money-addicted private management of the MRT,"" he said. 'Gov't should take over MRT ops' Meanwhile, the National Commuter Council for Public Safety called on government to look into the possibility of cancelling all existing contracts on the MRT and take over MRT operations. The call comes amid fears the train's alignment may have been compromised due to the pressures of use and over-capacity. The commuter group's president, Elvira Medina, told ANC government should conduct a thorough check of the MRT system, and conduct repairs and the necessary upgrading during the train's off hours.

2014-08-19,,,,"MANILA - A 73-year-old television executive may be sued by the owners of five of at least eight vehicles damaged when his car plunged from a parking building of the Greenhills Shopping Center last Friday. We are still waiting for at least four to five complainants to surface before filing the formal charges. The car owners were told to bring the estimate of the damages to their vehicles, San Juan police officer-in-charge Superintendent Jose Rivera said in an interview yesterday. One of the drivers of the damaged vehicles sustained slight injuries. Among the damaged vehicles were a Toyota Vios, Mitsubishi Montero Sport, Honda Jazz, Ford Ranger, Toyota Hi-Ace and Toyota Fortuner. He said he will only divulge the identities of the complainants after the formal filing of charges of reckless imprudence resulting in multiple damage to property and physical injuries against Juanito Nocos, vice president for sales of Basketball TV. Nocos reportedly passed out and lost control of his white Mitsubishi sedan, which crashed into five cars on the third level of the parking building and damaged four more vehicles when it crashed through the buildings wall and fell to the ground, police said.

Nocos has yet to talk to police investigators, according to Rivera. The San Juan police chief said they have yet to find out whether Nocos is wearing a pacemaker, a small device placed in the chest to help control abnormal heartbeat. People wearing pacemakers and those who underwent heart bypass surgery are banned by the Land Transportation Office from driving vehicles as they endanger other people, Rivera said. Nocos faces additional charges if he is found to be wearing a pacemaker, he added.

2014-02-20,,,Public officials,"  The truckers said they will resume normal operations only when the Manila ordinance on the truck ban is lifted.  Walang sinoman, kahit dating presidente pa siya, kahit dating artista pa siya yung pipigil sa kabuhayan natin, truckers' group leader Ricky Papa said in an interview on GMA News' early evening newscast, ""24 Oras"".  The Manila truck ban was originally scheduled for last February 10 but was postponed to February 24 to give the truckers more time to adjust.  Under the new city policy, trucks are banned from the streets of Manila from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m., Mondays through Saturdays.  But truck owner Jerwin Dumanog said their problem with that schedule is that factories are closed at night when the ban allows trucks to travel.  Malaki 'yung lugi sa factory. Kasi imaginin niyo isa lang ang darating na raw materials sa kanila. So sa isang buong araw parang isa lang yung matatapos nilang production. Marami ang kailangan nila so talagang babagal 'yung production nila, Dumanog said.  Papa noted that there is still heavy traffic along truck-free thoroughfares including EDSA, Espana Boulevard and Quezon Avenue.  Bakit lahat 'yan traffic? Hindi ba dapat mas pag aralan na baka may ibang pinanggagalingan 'yang traffic. he asked.  Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada said the city council is still open to changes.

2014-08-21,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesThe Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has temporarily suspended a joint administrative order meant to crack down on colorum trucks, until the operations at the Port of Manila have normalized. Speaking to reporters via phone interview, LTFRB chair Winston Ginez said the implementation of Joint Administrative Order (JAO) No. 2014-01 was deferred starting Thursday (Aug. 21), to ensure the smooth flow of trucks in and out of the countrys busiest port. This meant port-related trucks, whether loaded or not, will not be apprehended on the basis of the JAO until the resumption of normal operations at the Port of Manila. The imposition of this moratorium, which reportedly had the full support of Transportation and Communications Secretary Joseph Emilio Abaya according to Ginez, was deemed to be among the critical measures that could help resolve the truck congestion and the container pile up. Local companies have been reeling from a double whammy of double-digit losses in revenues and equally crippling surges in import and export related expenses since February this year. Such congestion was said to have stemmed primarily from Manilas expanded truck ban policy, which has banned eight wheelers and vehicles with a gross weight of above 4,500 kilos from plying the citys streets between 5 a.m. and 9 p.m. Government data have shown about 30,000 trucks plying Metro Manila, and of this number, 11,150 are reportedly port-related trucks. Jesus Lim Arranza, chairman of the Federation of Philippine Industries, meanwhile, lauded the move by LTFRB to impose a moratorium on the JAO, which was designed to ensure public road discipline and safety as it would impose penalties ranging from higher fines to revocation of the registration of the apprehended vehicle and all other authorized units included in the franchise. Arranza, however, said in an interview with reporters Thursday that the problems at the port would be resolved faster if the city government of Manila would temporarily put on hold the implementation of its expanded truck ban policy. This will be especially critical in the coming -ber months, which will see an influx of shipments. We hope (Manila) can temporarily suspend (this policy) so the solutions to the congestion can be fast-tracked. By September, people will start importing more and that will only aggravate and complicate the situation, Arranza explained. All the obstacles must be suspended so we can address the problems faster. Time is of the essence. Arranza likewise lauded the developments at the Manila port, which saw improvements in its operations over the last two and a half months. As of Thursday, only 8,000 overstaying containers were still at the port from the 20,000 recorded two and a half months ago, while the volume of containers from abroad (Singapore, Hong Kong and Kaoshung) have already declined to 20,000 containers from 37,000, government data showed. This meant that the overflow of 57,000 containers was already down to 28,000 containers, a development that would bode well for the peak season set to arrive in a few weeks time. The Philippine Ports Authority said this overflow of containers was above and beyond the normal capacity at the Manila Port. At full capacity, the port should handle some 81,000 containers, but the normal efficient yard utilization should be around 80 percent, or about 64,000 containers. A special chartered vessel, which was also arranged by the PPA, arrived Wednesday and had begun taking out of Manila some 3,000 containers that have been on hold due to various reasons, to be brought to Subic. The vessel, chartered at about P14 million for 15 days, has a capacity of about 1,200 containers per trip, which means that the containers can all be transferred within three days. The PPA however has yet to secure approvals from the Bureau of Customs to transfer even those (of the 3,000 containers) that have agricultural goods such as rice and garlic. Business groups have since stressed the need for the quick resolution of the congestion at the port, as this was making a significant dent on the countrys growth, as well as in the exports, imports and inflation rates. Its resolution would also enable the government to sustain the economic momentum that the country has so far been enjoying. Trade Secretary Gregory L. Domingo earlier said he expected the country to grow at a slower pace, or a tad lower than 6.5 percent. RELATED STORIES",Amy R.

2014-08-22,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesThe no-apprehension policy granting a temporary reprieve to colorum or unauthorized cargo trucks will continue, but only for those that deliver to and from the Manila port area. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) made the announcement two weeks after Malacaang said that the policyimplemented starting June 28 and later criticized for supposedly causing heavy traffic in the metropoliswould take effect only up to Aug. 15. In an interview with Inquirer editors and reporters Thursday, LTFRB Chair Winston Ginez maintained that due to the continuing congestion at the ports in Manila, special consideration must be given to 2,145 trucks that are tapped for port operations but have yet to secure provisional authority (PA) from the LTFRB. The PA serves as a temporary permit for trucks yet to comply with franchising requirements, and spares them from the P200,000 penalty imposed under Joint Administrative Order (JAO) No. 2014-01. The no-apprehension policy mainly suspends the implementation of the JAO. We dont want to leave the [Port of Manila] at a standstill. We should consider the bigger impact on industries, Ginez said. This is of a bigger national interest than (stopping) colorum operations. Business groups have blamed the port congestion on the expanded daytime truck ban (5 a.m. to 9 p.m.) implemented since February by the Manila City government. Despite clamors to lift the ban or suspend it for a few days, the city government headed by former President and now Mayor Joseph Estrada had only given concessions in the form of two express lanes that trucks can use 24/7. According to Ginez, the LTFRB received 33,000 permit applications from operators of trucks-for-hire ahead of the Aug. 15 deadline. Of this number, about 12,000 trucks have operations taking them to the Manila ports daily. Of the 12,000, about 2,000 have yet to secure PAs. Ginez did not give a definite timetable for the leeway granted to port-related truckers, saying it would continue until port operations normalize. To speed up the application process for these trucks, the Philippine Ports Authority will have them identified through the issuance of port users certificates while the LTFRB will set up a one-stop shop for PA applications. In a separate interview, Ginez said the continued suspension of the JAO would apply to port-related trucks, whether they are loaded or not. It also had the full support of Transportation Secretary Joseph Emilio Abaya, he added. Meanwhile, Jesus Lim Arranza, chair of the Federation of Philippine Industries, lauded the LTFRBs move but maintained that the problems at the port may be resolved faster if the Manila City government would suspend the truck ban as more shipments are expected to arrive in time for the Christmas season. By September, people will start importing more and that will only aggravate and complicate the situation, Arranza explained. All the obstacles must be suspended so we can address the problems faster. Time is of the essence. Arranza said there had actually been improvements in the Manila port operations over the last two and a half months. Latest government data showed that there are now only 8,000 overstaying containers at the port area, from the 20,000 recorded two and a half months earlier. The volume of Manila-bound containers stuck abroad (in Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan) has already shrunk to 20,000 from the peak level of 37,000. A special chartered vessel, whose services were sought by the PPA, arrived Wednesday and started moving 3,000 overstaying containers from Manila to Subic. The vessel, which can carry 1,200 containers per trip, was hired for P14 million to render a 15-day service. RELATED STORIES",Miguel R. Camus and Amy R.

2014-08-26,,,,"I would like to comment on Neal Cruzs June 23 column titled No fines for those who obey traffic rules. Other factors contributing to traffic congestion or slowdowns were not mentioned in the column: e.g., road projects, such as the Metropolitan Manila Development Authoritys (MMDA) Magallanes Interchange Rehab and the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) construction of a drainage/road improvement project along Espaa Boulevard. Also, there was no mention of the other traffic stakeholders: the MMDA, the DPWH, the commuters and the government agencies collecting fines. As a matter of fact, they were not given the chance to state their views for fair judgment. Cruz mentioned only the operators and drivers of passenger vehicles. Cruz also said that stiff fines make drivers drive carefully and avoid accidents and traffic violations. He should have added that operators and drivers should adhere not only to traffic rules and regulations but also to the standards of service demanded of them, instead of paying the penalty. Lastly, Cruz said, The desperate competition to get passengers and lack of accountability make drivers drive carelessly and violate traffic rules. Another reason is the boundary systemwhere drivers pay the bus, jeepney or tricycle operators a fixed amount; what is left of their earnings after paying the boundary becomes their take home pay. This is between the operators and their drivers and has nothing to do with collecting the fines on colorum vehicles.

2014-08-26,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesThe Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) has expressed its support for the government initiative to address port congestion in the City of Manila although it stressed that it would continue to go after truckers who disregard the truck ban. If truckers violate the existing ban, we will apprehend them, MMDA Assistant General Manager for Operations Emerson Carlos said in a recent interview. Last Friday, Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) Chair Winston Ginez announced that the no apprehension policy would continue to be enforced but only for 2,145 colorum or unauthorized trucks making deliveries to and from the Manila port. According to Ginez, these trucks have yet to be granted by his agency provisional authority (PA) which will spare them from paying the P200,000 fine stipulated under Joint Administrative Order No. 2014-01 while they wait for the approval of their franchise application. Ginez explained that they were temporarily suspending the implementation of the joint order against these trucks to ensure [the] sufficiency and availability of cargo trucks until operations at the Port of Manila normalize. However, he stressed that truckers should observe the truck ban, the regulations for the use of the 24/7 express trade lanes as well as traffic rules set by the MMDA, Manila City government and other local government units. For his part, Carlos stressed that the PA was not a license for truckers to [ply their routes] anytime and anywhere. He reminded truck drivers and operators about the 24/7 total truck ban on Edsafrom the stretch of Magallanes in Makati to North Avenue in Quezon City. As for major roads like Marcos Highway, Aurora Boulevard, Katipunan, Commonwealth, C5 and Quezon Boulevard, they will be off-limits to trucks and heavy vehicles with a gross capacity weight of over 4,500 kilograms from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. and between 5 p.m. and 10 p.m. every day, except Sundays and holidays. However, trucks carrying perishable goods and petroleum products are exempted from the ban. Violators, on the other hand, face a P2,000 fine. In line with this, Carlos encouraged traders and truckers to take advantage of holidays and weekends for making deliveries. During the agencys weekly radio program, Carlos noted that only 500 trucks were operating from Saturday to Monday morning as shown by Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) records.

2014-08-27,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesFaking it was apparently as easy as A-B-C. The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) on Tuesday said several bus operators had been caught faking MMDA stickers under the agencys Bus Segregation Scheme, enabling them to deceive traffic marshals and stop anywhere they like on Edsa. At least 14 buses with fake stickers had been apprehended and their operators slapped with fines since last month, prompting the MMDA to devise a new marking system. We cannot say that these (new) stickers will not be copied again by bus operators but at least it will take time for them to do that, MMDA chair Francis Tolentino said. Bus operators and drivers have been resorting to using counterfeit stickers to defraud the enforcers so that they can load and unload passengers anywhere they please. Its high time to put an end to bus drivers wanton disregard of the law. In 2012, the agency launched the segregation scheme on Edsa, a measure aimed at easing traffic congestion on the highway by preventing long queues from forming at bus stops. Under the scheme, buses are marked A, B and C based on the stops where they are allowed to load or unload passengers. A and B buses are limited to certain bus stops while C buses are allowed at all stops on Edsa. The previous stickers were supposed to be valid for only one year and now that (the scheme) has reached its second year, more buses have tried to fake them, especially the C sticker, Tolentino noted. The MMDA chair admitted that the new stickers would not be 100-percent tamper-proof but noted that unscrupulous operators would have difficulty copying them because of the new color-coded system. While the previous bus stickers were colored red, blue and a combination of the two, the new system will have green, yellow and orange stickers. Buses with yellow stickers will follow the designated loading and unloading bays of Bus A: Magallanes, Buendia, Guadalupe, Shaw Boulevard, SM Megamall, Boni Serrano, Cubao Farmers and Ermin Garcia for northbound buses, and Ermin Garcia, Arayat Cubao, VV Soliven, Connecticut, Shaw Starmall, Guadalupe, Buendia Aveue and Mantrade for southbound buses. Buses with green stickers will stop at Bus B loading and unloading bays. For northbound buses, the stops are at Ayala Avenue, Estrella, Pioneer/Boni, SM Megamall, Ortigas Avenue, Main Avenue and Baliwag/5 Star, while the stops for southbound buses are at Kamuning, Monte de Piedad, Main Avenue, POEA Ortigas, Pioneer/Boni, Estrella and Ayala Avenue. Buses with orange stickers are allowed to load and unload at all bus stops along Edsa. The new stickers will be issued free of charge to bus operators. Violators of the scheme are fined P1,000 for the first offense, P2,000 for the second and P3,000 for the third and subsequent offenses. RELATED STORY",Maricar B.

2014-08-30,,,,"To reduce the number of trucks passing traffic-prone C-5 Road, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) said it will start a one-lane policy for trucks on Monday, with a test run on Saturday morning. MMDA Chair Francis Tolentino said the measure is aimed at addressing traffic congestion in the entire stretch of C-5 caused by a huge volume of trucks passing through the road. Studies showed that there was an 80-percent increase in the total volume of trucks plying C-5 during the granting of provisional permits to the applicants and the no-apprehension policy of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board, he said. To address this problem, the Special Traffic Committee of the Metro Manila Council, the policy-making body of the MMDA, passed Resolution No. 5 Series of 2014 which laid out rules to be followed by truckers taking the C-5 route starting Monday until January 31, 2015.

Quezon City Mayor Herbert Bautista has referred the plan to the Department of Public Order and Safety for implementation. Elmo San Diego, the public order and safety departments head, said the three thoroughfares identified by the mayor are commonly used by trucks. To avoid swerving and control the trucks, well designate dedicated lanes. Thats the agreement with the (Metropolitan Manila Development Authority), San Diego said.

2014-09-01,,,,"An international group sought to convince the City of Manila to hold on to its ports as its container operations outweigh the gains in transferring activities to alternate ports in Batangas and Subic. The Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said redirecting port operations to alternate ports to decongest roads and address the problematic backlog in the transport of container vans in the ports of Manila may not necessarily be a sound solution based on a recent study on port cities. A paper published by OECD entitled ""Competitiveness of Global Port-Cities: Synthesis Report"" indicated that although port and cities were historically strongly linked, the link between port and city growth has become weaker. The study cited Manila among the bustling port cities in Asia along with Shanghai, Osaka, and Mumbai. ""Many of the largest cities have the largest ports. This is particularly the case of many Asian cities such as Shanghai and Osaka-Kobe which are among the 20 largest metropolitan areas and also home to the 20 largest ports in the world,"" the OECD study noted, pointing out that well-functioning ports lower the costs of trade, generate value added and employment and attract certain economic sectors. ""One ton of port throughput is on average associated with $100 of economic value added, and an increase in 1 million tons of throughput is associated with an increase in employment in the port region of 300 jobs in the short term,"" it said. The study also noted that road congestion, which is common among port cities, not only hampers port competitiveness but is also considered a major nuisance to urban citizens. It suggested the use of port gate strategies and modal shift strategies as solutions to ease vehicular traffic among port cities. Main policy instruments in port gate strategies are terminal appointment systems, extending gate hours and virtual container yard systems. The study stressed that urban governments' land use policy will have a huge role to play in assuring the efficiency of ports in port cities, saying that land use plans can constitute an important consultation mechanism for ensuring that stakeholders are aligned with the direction of future port developments."" It also recommended the shift towards other transport modes such as rail, inland waterways, pipelines and short sea shipping to reduce port-related traffic congestion, noting that recent studies have stressed the important role of ports in global supply chains. The effectiveness of ports depends on how they are linked in these chains,"" the study said. It also said, however, that the interaction between ports and their cities is underpinned by a set of policy dilemmas because port authorities and city governments do not necessarily have the same interests, goals and perception of challenges and policies that are needed. Urban governments generally have a wider set of challenges to solve, including housing and urban transportation, both issues of high relevance to their electorate so they will tend to prioritize urban passenger transportation and have an interest in redeveloping waterfronts into housing areas, it noted. The study pointed out that enhancing the synergy between the urban government and the harbors in port cities redounds to the benefit of the communities where these are located. Port-related value added and employment is strongly related to urban wealth, stressing that ports can be made more competitive by strengthening their maritime links, port operations and hinterland connections. Manila port congestion was aggravated by the imposition of a stringent truck ban in February by the City of Manila prohibiting cargo trucks in the city street between 5:00 am to 9:00 pm that has resulted to the massive accumulation of empty container vans in the container terminal. The Philippine Ports Authority has had to resort to calling on businesses to withdraw their shipments during weekends as a stop-gap measure as the national government prepares alternative ports in Subic north of Manila and Batangas in the south. PPA general manager Juan Sta. Ana told media it will take months before normal levels in terminal traffic can be achieved; mitigation measures currently imposed will not be enough to bring port congestion to pre- Manila daytime truck ban period. Manila port congestion has reached a height of 22,000 20-foot container equivalent units (TEU) while laden containers piled up reaching 99,000 TEUs that occupied 105 percent of the docks of the Manila International Container Terminal and the Manila South Harbor. The report, written by OECD public governance and territorial development directorate administrator for port-cities Olaf Merk, was based on the findings from a series of OECD Port-Cities case studies, including those of Le Havre/Rouen/Paris/Caen (France); Hamburg (Germany); Helsinki (Finland); Marseille (France); Mersin (Turkey); Rotterdam/Amsterdam (Netherlands); Antofagasta (Chile); Bratislava/Komarno/Sturova (Slovak Republic); Durban (South Africa); and Shanghai (China). The OECD Port-Cities Programme aims to identify how ports can be assets for urban development. The programme assesses the impact of ports on cities and regions. It also compares policies aimed at increasing positive regional impacts of ports and limiting negative effects.

2014-09-04,,,,"CEBU CITYTwo agencies of the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) rejected a plea made by public utility vehicle (PUV) operators here to spare them from fines being imposed on erring PUV drivers. In a recent dialogue with DOTC officials, Chiquito Obeso, head of the Metro Cebu Taxi Operators Association, pleaded to the Land Transportation Office (LTO) and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), two agencies under DOTC, to spare operators of PUVs from the hefty fines. The hefty fines are designed to supposedly impose discipline among PUV drivers and serve as deterrent to traffic violations. The fees are also a means by the DOTC to raise funds. But in next years national budget, the DOTC is seeking a bigger allocation that would supposedly be spent on the operations of a rail transit system in Metro Manila that every taxpayer in the country is subsidizing. In a statement, pastor Benny Abante, a former member of the House of Representatives, said despite all the steps being taken by the DOTC to impose heavy fines on traffic rule violators, it is still unable to address major transport problems besieging highly urbanized areas in the country, including Metro Manila and Metro Cebu. Abante said Congress should take a closer look at the proposed increase in the DOTC budget to find out if the department deserved it. The DOTC has to prove that it is ready to implement new projects since it has not proven the ability to improve mass transport services for our people, said Abante, who was vice chair of the House appropriations committee during his term as legislator. Abante said it would be unfair for taxpayers in the rest of the country to pay for the operations of the MRT, which would get P6.6 billion in increased allocation for the DOTC. Subsidies from taxes alone for the MRT operation, he said, would amount to P4.6 billion. Yet, he said, the DOTC has failed to improve the operations of the rail system that millions of commuters in Metro Manila use daily. The DOTC receives billions of pesos in funding for the MRT but it is perplexing how it cannot avoid inconveniencing passengers a total of 300 times in the past years because of different problems, said Abante. For a rail service that is not even 15 years old and subsidized by the taxes of our people, I cannot understand why the MRT has so many of these unfortunate incidents, he said, referring to accidents that befell the rail system. During the dialogue with DOTC officials here, Obeso said he found it unfair for operators to be fined, too, for their drivers violation. Operators face fines of up to P15,000 for their drivers offenses. Obeso said drivers are beyond operators control if they are already on the road.",,"9:45 AM | Thursday, September 4th, 2014",,yes,2014-09-04 00:00:00,enforcement of existing lawsordinances,,,,,Ex-solon says House should examine if department deserves bigger budget amid boo-boos,,,english,,http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/635159/dotc-rejects-cebu-puv-owners-plea-vs-hefty-fines,,"cebu, metro manila, manila",text,,47.0,,1857.0,,mavie,,,traffic enforcement and violations,7.5,Straight News,,,,,,inquirer,no,,,,,DOTC rejects Cebu PUV owners plea vs hefty fines  | Inquirer News,Neutral,,
2014-09-04,,,,"MANILA - The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) is appealing to the public to bear with a new measure aimed at decongesting Metro Manila's ports and facilitating faster delivery of goods to warehouses. Speaking to ANC, MMDA chairman Francis Tolentino said the Cabinet has approved a measure that will open ""last mile"" routes for cargo trucks. These routes will allow cargo trucks taking express trade lanes to complete the delivery of goods to their designated end-point in case they are caught on the road outside their travel window. The measure will be implemented from September 8 to 22. ''We might experience congestion for the next two weeks until September 22. What we're going to do this coming Sunday is that those who will support the port operations during weekends will be given incentives. Those who will support will be given a merit, so to speak, by having a tag allowing them to use the last mile,'' Tolentino said. ''If you are coming out of the port on a Sunday, the MMDA and LTFRB (Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board) will provide a tag that will allow you to use the last mile route without fear of being apprehended even during the next two weeks."" Tolentino said due to the last mile solution, there is a possibility that trucks will be seen along Aurora Boulevard, Sucat Road, and Nagtahan area even during truck ban hours. Tolentino, however, stressed that only cargo trucks bearing a tag provided by the MMDA will be able to take advantage of the two-week implementation of the ""last mile routes"" approach. The last mile solution was discussed during a recent Cabinet cluster meeting which tackled solutions in solving congestion in Manila's ports. The MMDA explained that in transportation, the ''last mile'' refers to the movement of people and goods from a transport hub to its final destination. From the point of view of truckers, this refers to the movement of cargo trucks from the port to their warehouses inside and outside Metro Manila. The government came up with the last mile routes solution after truckers noted that even if they use the 24/7 express lanes in Manila  located along Roxas Boulevard, Quirino Avenue, and Osmea Highway - some of them are still not able to deliver the goods to the warehouses because of the enforcement of truck ban ordinances in other parts of Metro Manila. At least 2,000 trucks allowed to use the last mile routes will be tagged on Saturday.

2014-09-05,,,," MANILA - A massive traffic jam affected the North Luzon Expressway (NLEx) on Friday, and no government unit or agency took the blame for the fiasco. A post on the official Twitter page of NLEx said the massive traffic build-up was caused by the poor movement of vehicles along A. Bonifacio Avenue. It initially attributed the heavy traffic to the ""one-truck lane policy"" on the said road for the gridlock. However, Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) Chairman Francis Tolentino pointed out that no one-truck lane policy was being implemented on A. Bonifacio Avenue. He said the one-truck lane is only being implemented along C-5 Road. ""MMDA's one truck lane policy is only applicable along C-5. These are the trucks going to enter the gates of the Philippine Ports Authority, so the Port of Manila has some problems in so far as the processing of trucks entering the ports. The queue has reached that long,"" Tolentino told ANC. ""The problem lies in the congested cargoes inside Port of Manila. It has nothing to do with any truck policy. Some are barking on the wrong tree."" Upon exiting NLEx, trucks go to A. Bonifacio Avenue to reach C-3 Road. C-3 Road is connected to Road-10 (R-10), one of the primary roads leading to Manila's ports. Tolentino explained that there is a portion of C-3 Road that is only ""one lane passable."" He also appealed to NLEx management to withdraw its claim that a one-truck lane policy is causing the traffic jam. The Palace, meanwhile, put the blame on the government of Caloocan for the gridlock. Speaking to reporters, Cabinet Secretary Jose Rene Almendras said the national government discovered just today that Caloocan altered several routes in the city, noting that no new truck policy was implemented in the affected roads. ""Nabigla kami over the past few days kung bakit biglang sumikip. I have been checking iyung volume of trucks na lumalabas sa pier - it is the same,"" Almendras said. ""Ngayong umaga, nalaman natin na may ginawang re-routing sa Calooocan, we have elevated this to Chairman Tolentino, na kung pwede ibalik natin ang mga ruta na nandoon dati... Some roads were suddenly closed, some truck roads were diverted. They imposed a single lane."" Almendras explained that a single ""express lane"" along Roxas Boulevard has been there since April. ""Iyung single lane was the commitment for the express lanes na 24/7. Pero during hours na walang truck ban, we are back to the original na walang single lane,"" he said. Due to the gridlock, many vehicles got stuck on NLEx's southbound lane for hours. The tail-end of the traffic build-up  reached Valenzuela Interchange. Some passengers also got stranded. Chris Saruca, officer-in-charge of the MMDA Traffic Discipline Office, said more traffic enforcers were deployed to ensure better flow of vehicles in the affected roads. Charlie Nosares of the MMDA MetroBase, meanwhile, advised motorists exiting NLEx to use Mindanao Avenue, Valenzuela going to MacArthur Highway, or Malinta Exit going to San Jose Del Monte, Bulacan to avoid traffic. Some irate motorists and passengers, meanwhile, took to Twitter to air their frustration over the massive gridlock. Some also called for a long-term solution to the traffic situation.

2014-09-06,,,,"A blame game is in full swing following the horrendous traffic gridlock on Friday along the southbound lane of the North Luzon Expressway (NLEx) and roads leading to the Port of Manila. Brace yourself for at least two more weeks of the same. Authorities could not agree on a single cause of the widespread traffic gridlock: Was it due to the one-truck lane policy, coordination failure among traffic enforcement groups in the metropolis, or the sheer volume of cargo trucks moving their container vans from the Port of Manila to the Port of Subic? Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) Chair Francis Tolentino blamed the gridlock on Friday on the heavy volume of cargo trucks getting their container vans out of the port premises, a pileup caused by the slow processing of incoming trucks by the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA). The massive truck movement was also the result of a directive from Malacaang that ordered truckers to move their container vans from the Port of Manila to the Port of Subic, according to Larry Castro of Caloocans Department of Public Safety and Traffic Management. Tolentino said the port was at full capacity and it would take at least two weeks to decongest it. The traffic gridlock on Friday started at 5 a.m. By 4:22 p.m., the queue of southbound vehicles exiting NLEx at Edsa-Balintawak had extended all the way to the NLEx exit at Meycauyan, Bulacan province, prompting pedestrians and commuters to walk or jump traffic barriers to get out of the expressway. The MMDA chair said the agency had already advised private vehicles coming from the north to take the Mindanao Avenue exit. He added that the MMDA was also planning to implement a counterflow scheme to ease the traffic problem. The PPA should expedite their internal processes to allow the faster entry and exit of trucks getting their container vans inside PPA premises, Tolentino said. The NLEx had earlier tweeted on its site that the traffic was caused by the MMDAs one-truck lane policy, a claim immediately denied by Tolentino, who said that the one-truck lane policy was only observed along C-5 road and Roxas Boulevard, a 24/7 truck express lane. The NLEx traffic site quickly apologized and retracted its tweet. @MMDA On behalf of our company, we apologize for what was tweeted. We dont mean to cause any harm. We hope for your understanding, @NLEx Traffic tweeted. Tolentino said the agency had implemented a one-truck lane/ queuing scenario along C-3 because of the limited capacity of the road and the heavy volume of trucks going to the port. He added that some road repairs along C-3 also contributed to the traffic problem. Many people thought that there was a one-truck lane policy along NLEx, A. Bonifacio and C-3, that caused the heavy traffic. (B)ut there is none. The buildup was caused by the sheer volume of cargo trucks going to and coming from the Manila port, the MMDA chair explained. Netizens had expressed their frustration over the traffic situation on social media, with some of them saying that their usual 15-minute ride from nearby areas in Bulacan had stretched to more than an hour. All lanes southbound to Metro Manila were affected. Marlene Ochoa, vice president of corporate communications of the Manila North Tollways Corp. (MNTC), said that apart from increasing traffic patrol teams and informing motorists via social media sites about the traffic situation, the company will also consider a single-lane truck scheme within NLEx. Ochoa stopped short of blaming any group for the traffic queue that some reports described as being nine kilometers long, but she said it was likely an external issue. Our traffic record speaks for itself, this does not happen in NLEx, Ochoa said in an interview on Friday. In an earlier Radyo Inquirer interview, Jeffrey Vendevil, traffic control supervisor of NLEx, had blamed the one-lane policy for trucks for the gridlock. Trucks attempting to get out of NLEx are being slowed down, and that blocks the other vehicles going out of the expressway, he said. He added that despite the one-lane policy, the long body and sheer size of the cargo trucks had resulted in them using two lanes in areas like C-3 and 5th Avenue in Caloocan. This, in turn, blocked other vehicles, causing a pileup. Rhoderick Tongol of Malabons Public Safety and Traffic Management Office, meanwhile, said the city had also been implementing its own one-lane policy, although the heavy traffic only started on Tuesday. Weve decided to implement our own experimental one-lane policy for trucks, Tongol said, adding that he and representatives of Caloocan, Navotas and Valenzuela traffic offices and the MMDA North Camanava Sector had met at the Malabon City Hall a week ago to discuss their response to Manilas one-lane policy. Heavy traffic was to be expected from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., the only window in the truck ban when trucks can go out and deliver their cargo, he said. Tongol said there should be better coordination among the different parties. In NLEx they can use all (the) lanes, he said, adding that in the Camanava areas, the trucks are being controlled like a funnel. NLEx should implement its own one lane, he said. Despite the bumper-to-bumper traffic, they still have control over the situation, Tongol said. When theres too much traffic, we reroute the trucks by making them pass through C-4, Letre and Dagat-dagatan. The private cars and public utility vehicles can still pass through all our roads. Castro also pointed to the practice among some truckers of parking on roads leading to the port area while waiting out the truck ban as aggravating the problem. He said members of their special operations unit had been tasked to focus on those areas. Ochoa said the MNTC was currently reviewing a measure to limit trucks plying NLEx to a single dedicated lane. The company was also deploying more traffic patrol teams in coordination with the MMDA to direct traffic in the Edsa-Balintawak Cloverleaf, the Mindanao Avenue Link and the Balintawak-Bonifacio road. The traffic patrols will guide trucks to the inner lanes dedicated to them while also guiding cars and other vehicles to the free lanes, Ochoa said. Our Bocaue Toll Plaza tellers had also been instructed to provide traffic updates to motorists in addition to the updates on @Nlex Traffic on Twitter and NLigtas app, she added.

2014-09-06,,,,"MANILA - Traffic is starting to build up again along the North Luzon Expressway (NLEx) on Saturday morning. From the Balintawak Cloverleaf, the line of vehicles stretched some two kilometers at around 4 a.m. To help ease congestion, the management of NLEx opened a counterflow lane along the Camachille area in Balintawak to serve vehicles headed to A. Bonifacio Avenue. Motorists entering Metro Manila were advised to take the Mindanao Avenue exit to avoid the build up. On Friday, the trafffic jam in NLEx stretched over 9 kilometers from the Balintawak Interchange. Many vehicles got stuck on NLEx's southbound lane for hours, and many passengers also got stranded. No one, however, has taken responsibility for the traffic mess. The NLEx management earlier claimed that the heavy traffic was caused by the one-truck lane policy of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA). But the MMDA immediately denied this, pointing out that no one-truck lane policy was being implemented on A. Bonifacio Avenue. MMDA chairman Francis Tolentino blamed the congestion in the Port of Manila as the reason behind the gridlock. The Palace, meanwhile, said the rerouting scheme in Caloocan might have caused the traffic mess. --","With reports from Dexter Ganibe, dzMM; ANC",ABS-CBNnews.com,Metropolitan Manila Development Authority,yes,2014-09-06 00:00:00,"reports on traffic congestion,traffic advisories",,,,,,,,english,,http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/09/06/14/counterflow-lane-opened-ease-nlex-traffic,,"caloocan, metro manila, manila",text,,479.0,,2100.0,,candice,,,traffic congestion,5.0,Straight News,,,,,,abs-cbnnews,no,,,,,Counterflow lane opened to ease NLEx traffic,,,
2014-09-06,,,," The local government of Caloocan has suspended its two-truck lane policy which it only started implementing three days ago, a report from GMA's 24 Oras said Saturday. According to City Deputy Chief Benito Go, the move comes after the policy was blamed for the massive build up of traffic last Friday. Kami [ang] nasisisi. Wala naman sa amin ang problema... Hindi nila alam ang sinasabi nila na nagkaroon kami ng re-routing, wala namang re-routing, Go said. Akala kasi nila 'yung C-3 Road dire-diretso 'yun. Kasi three lanes lang ang C3, para 'yung isang lane naman maiwan doon sa mga private na motorista, He continued. Amid this announcement, the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) sent 200 personnel to help manage the traffic situation. Since 2007, wala na ang MMDA sa area na ito. Ngayon lang kami babalik. Walang MMDA sa A. Bonifacio, sa Del Pan at mga area na 'yun, MMDA Chairman Francis Tolentino said. On Friday, scores of commuters were forced to walk following a massive build up of traffic at the North Luzon Expressway (NLEX) which stretched some five kilometers from Meycauayan in Bulacan to A. Bonifacio in Quezon City. The traffic situation is purportedly caused by the Last Mile route which was announced by the government as a drastic solution to port congestion. The last mile route allows cargo trucks to ply truck lanes around the clock on two consecutive Sundays and Mondays.

2014-09-06,,,,"As it looks for solutions to the congestion at the Manila ports, Malacaang found itself dealing with another problem on the road: Extortionist traffic officers preying on truckers. Cabinet Secretary Rene Almendras on Friday said an anti-kotong (mulcting) task force had been formed to ensure that no traffic marshal would take advantage of the lack of clarity on what is a truck route or what is an express lane. He was referring to the different roads or lanes designated by the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) and local government units to restrict truck operations in order to ease traffic. Almendras said that in a three-and-a-half hour Palace meeting with truckers, shippers, port operators, and other government officials on Friday, it became apparent that not all traffic officers understand the various government measures related to trucking. Were going to be launching an invigorated anti-kotong operation particularly (on officers) targeting these trucks, he said in a press briefing. We are setting up a special head office to ensure that we will be able to respond to the trucks that will be inappropriately detained or inappropriately arrested, to make sure that we can explain to the traffic enforcers and to the other people that during these next two weeks, we want to move as much cargo as we can from the port. The government would face this challenge head on with the new task force that would be under the National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO), he said, adding that Philippine National Police chief Director General Alan Purisima had assigned Chief Supt. Allen Bantolo of the NCRPO to be part of the effort. Earlier, Almendras announced that drastic steps would be taken to address the pileup of freight containers in the ports as a result of truck ban imposed by the Manila City government since February. The measures include a two-week special privilege window where the MMDA and the Land Transportation and Franchising Regulatory Board would be issuing special tags and permit to allow trucks to take the last mile and the 24-hour express truck lanes. The scheme will be in effect from Sept. 8 to Sept. 22 to move unclaimed containers, many of which had been kept at the Manila ports for almost three months. By Oct. 1, owners of unclaimed containers would be fined P5,000 for each day their shipments would remain in the ports.",Nikko Dizon,"5:00 AM | Saturday, September 6th, 2014",,yes,2014-09-06 00:00:00,"truck ban,traffic enforcement,traffic management schemes",,,,,,,,english,,http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/635730/lack-of-clarity-on-truck-lanes-breeding-kotong,,manila,text,,752.0,,2017.0,,pia,,,"traffic enforcement and violations, traffic congestion",4.5,-,,,,,,inquirer,no,,,,,Lack of clarity on truck lanes breeding kotong | Inquirer News,,,
2014-09-07,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesA Malacaang official on Saturday apologized for the monster gridlock on the southbound lane of the North Luzon Expressway (NLEX) and on the roads leading to the Port of Manila last Friday, saying the government was exploring ways to ease traffic in Metro Manila. We apologize for the major traffic congestion. Our monitoring showed that by 3 a.m. on Saturday, the traffic on NLEX had already been fixed, presidential spokesperson Edwin Lacierda said over government-run Radyo ng Bayan. Asked if the heavy traffic would negate the economic achievements the government has been flaunting, Lacierda said the traffic should not affect the conduct of business. Traffic, in a sense, also indicates the type of economy that were experiencing right now. But as much as it is a sign of a growing economy, we also need and we recognize the need to make sure that traffic does not impede the flow of business productivity. And for that particular reason, we are looking at measures to alleviate traffic in Metro Manila, Lacierda said. He said the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has conducted a study on the loss of business due to traffic, and for that particular reason, we have been studying these measures, how do we alleviate traffic, especially in Metro Manila and the NCR (National Capital Region) area? Lacierda said solutions to the traffic mess include prohibiting provincial buses from entering Metro Manila and going after illegal or colorum vehicles. He said that the number coding scheme of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) has also helped in easing traffic congestion. Added to the problem of traffic is the deteriorating Metro Rail Transit (MRT) service with commuters queuing for hours just to get on a train. The MRT has also been hounded by accidents the past months. The state of public transportation, particularly the MRT, is now the subject of a Senate investigation. The heavy traffic has also been blamed on the truck ban imposed by Metro Manilas local governments. The truck ban of the Manila city government, in particular, has resulted in congestion at the Port of Manila as truckers cannot get all their containers out. With the port congestion already affecting the economy, Malacaang gave owners of the containers and truckers two weeks to remove their container vans from the Manila port. But this resulted in a massive truck movement that led to heavy traffic. The source of the traffic is because of the port congestion where the trucks are now really moving their empty containers, Lacierda said. Traffic at the NLEX southbound returned to normal on Saturday. As of 2:57 p.m., NLEX Traffic reported that both northbound and southbound traffic were fast moving. It earlier reported that southbound traffic at 12:57 a.m. had already been light and then returned to heavy from 5:20 a.m. to around 9 a.m., starting at 500 meters from the Balintawak-Cloverleaf and eventually stretching 1.7 kilometers from there, which prompted the NLEX management to conduct counterflow operations. To prevent a repeat of Fridays horrendous traffic particularly near the Port of Manila, authorities announced on Saturday the activation of Task Force Pantalan, the opening of counterflow points and the deployment of around 200 MMDA personnel to the area. In a press briefing, MMDA Chair Francis Tolentino said the task forcecomposed of the MMDA, the National Capital Region Police Office and affected local government unitswill oversee traffic operations from (NLEX)-Camachile to R10 Del Pan. He said the task force headed by Chief Supt. Allen Bantolo, NCRPO deputy director for operations, and Cris Saruca, chief of the MMDAs Traffic Discipline Office, would remain activated for the next two weeks during which the port would be decongested. According to Tolentino, the authorities have also opened counterflow points to ease traffic near the port. On NLEX, lets start with Camachile. Camachile is three kilometers from the (Balintawak) toll plaza. Private vehicles and buses will be allowed to exit to Camachile until Sept. 21 going to Monumento, he said. He said counterflow to exit to Balintawak would also be allowed underneath A. Bonifacio as the need arises. He said there was also a pending request with NLEX authorities for the deactivation of a toll plaza in Balintawak going to the north so it could be used as a counterflow on a permanent basis by private vehicles.

2014-09-07,,,,"MANILA -- Is the Philippines prepared to host the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit next year given the worsening traffic situation in Metro Manila? That's what Senator Ralph Recto is asking the government as the country gears up for next year's meeting of world leaders from the Asia Pacific region. If Barrack Obama and Vladimir Putin will hug and pose for a selfie in November next year, will they be doing it in a metropolis that international reporters covering the APEC summit would hail as safe and clean? Or will the traditional class picture of APEC leaders have cargo trucks stuck in traffic as background? Recto asked. The APEC meeting, which will be held in November next year, is expected to be attended by 10,000 delegates, journalists and support staff. While the exact venue where it will be held has yet to be announced, several reports said the summit and most of the preparatory conferences will be held in Metro Manila. Recto is suggesting that hearings on the proposed 2015 budget should be used to audit APEC requirements. He said he is amenable to a building spree for as long as these are not cosmetic in nature. According to Recto, the government is seeking a P4.6-billion budget for the APEC, booked under the International Commitments Fund section. Recto noted, however, that this is only for hosting requirements alone and outside-of-venue needs like sprucing up the airport. A crash Metro Manila makeover is also found in the 2015 budget. There is a P1.9 billion allocation for the rehabilitation of EDSA, there is another P1.9 billion to repair flyovers. There is a P600 million for the repair of NAIA. In the budget of the DPWH, there is at least P30 billion worth of projects which will be implemented in NCR, Recto pointed out, noting that the Manila International Airport Authoritys annual net income of P3 billion should prompt the agency to upgrade passenger comfort facilities. Moreover, at present, Roxas Boulevard and Luneta are being improved at a cost of P457 million,"" he said. In addition, privately funded road projects like the P15.5 billion, 7-kilometer NAIA expressway and the Skyway Stage 3 project are proceeding smoothly, he said, adding that 11 other big ticket items ranging from overpasses to rail line extensions are all on the drawing board. Not all projects are related to the APEC, however. But just the same, those which are scheduled to be finished before APEC must be done so. And for those which are not, then some kind of a traffic management program for each must be developed because we don't want media coverage on the APEC to focus on how bad traffic is in Metro Manila, he said. Recto said if APEC is what led government to ask more funds for Metro Manila, then so be it because after the guests are gone, then the area is left with new or better infrastructure. If its the fear of bungling the APEC hosting duties which drives the government to go on a building-spree, then it is alright for as long as it will leave dividends to be enjoyed. Whatever the motivation is for as long the end is good, he said.",,ABS-CBNnews.com,Senator,yes,2014-09-07 00:00:00,"reports on traffic congestion,apec",,,,,,,,english,,http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/focus/09/07/14/will-traffic-choked-manila-be-ready-apec,,"metro manila, manila, roxas",text,,170.0,,1246.0,,mavie,,,traffic congestion,6.5,Straight News,,,,,,abs-cbnnews,no,,,,,Will traffic-choked Manila be ready for APEC?,Neutral,,
2014-09-07,,,," Traffic in Metro Manila is expected to be heavy on Monday as the two-week implementation of the ""24-hour Last Mile Route"" for trucks coming from and going to Manila ports starts, a television report said. According to a report by Steve Dailisan on ""Balitanghali,"" trucks with Special Truck Lane Pass (Last Mile) stickers and painted ""Lasmayl"" tags from the Metro Manila Development Authority will be allowed to travel trade lanes on designated truck routes for 24 hours. Trucks tagged for the last mile route will be able to travel the main roads from September 8 to September 21, even during the truck ban hours, as long as they carry cargo for shipment to their designated end-points, the report added. Designated truck routes include A. Bonifacio Avenue coming from NLEX, passing through C-3 and Caloocan, straight to Road 10 to Manila's ports. Trucks coming from CAVITEX may go straight on Roxas Blvd. to the port area. Moreover, trucks coming from Southern Luzon may pass through Osmea Highway-Quirino to Roxas Boulevard until it enters the port. According to the MMDA, this policy is part of an agreement with Task Force Pantalan to ease congestion at Manila ports. MMDA aims to reduce the number of trucks in the port area by at least 20,000. Following this two-week policy, motorists can expect heavy traffic on the main roads in Metro Manila for the next two weeks. Meanwhile, the report quoted the MMDA as saying it is ready to open counterflow lanes at the NLEX as well as in Delpan Bridge in case of traffic build up in some areas. They are also planning to open up to two lanes on Road 10 to avoid repeating the heavy traffic experienced by motorists last Friday. MMDA Assistant Genral Manager for Operations Atty. Emerson Carlos said only trucks with the special stickers and painted tags may travel via the designated truck routes. Trucks without these stickers are still subject to the Manila truck ban policy. Under the ""last mile"" route policy, trucks with stickers and tags still cannot pass through EDSA, Katipunan, Ortigas, Recto and Taft Avenue. As of Sunday morning, some 120 trucks have been tagged by MMDA's Task Force Pantalan for the last mile route.

2014-02-18,,,," Manila eyeing restrictions on public jeepneys, UV Express MANILA -- There is no stopping the daytime truck ban in Manila, which is scheduled to take effect on February 24, according to Manila Vice Mayor Isko Moreno. The truck ban is the city's latest ordinance designed to help ease traffic problems. Under the ordinance, eight-wheel trucks with a gross weight of above 4,500 kilograms will only be allowed on city streets from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. every day except on Saturdays and Sundays. ""Base sa polisiya ni Mayor Erap [Estrada], tuloy na sa 24 yung truck ban. Yan ay talagang gagawin ng lungsod at kinakailangan... I think it's high time, in fact tayo na lang yata sa siyudad o kapitolyo ng bansa na may mga truck operation during daytime,"" Moreno said in an interview with ""Mornings @ ANC"" on Tuesday. Gravel and sand trucks, cargo trucks, cement mixers, sand tractor trailers and containerized trucks are included in the travel ban, while refrigerated haulers carrying perishable goods, oil tankers, and trucks used for government projects are exempted from the ban. On July last year, Manila also passed an ordinance banning city and provincial buses without existing terminals in the city. In the resolution, provincial buses with private terminals within the city are still allowed to enter but they cannot unload passengers along the road. Buses coming from places such as Quezon City, San Juan and Makati are barred from entering Manila. According to Moreno, the scheme has significantly brought down the number of buses traversing Manila. He said they are now also looking at making similar restrictions on other transportation modes such as jeepneys and UV Express units. ""We're going to attend to 14,000 jeeps and 4,500 UV Express... Sa jeepney drivers ito muna ang pakiusap namin: Pag may pumara, itabi po ninyo. Huhulihin na po namin kayo. At yung UV Express, bilang na po ang araw po ninyo. Sana po sumunod na kayo sa prangkisa ninyo,"" he said. Meanwhile, the vice mayor said the city government of Manila is open to the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority's (MMDA) proposal of a 4-day school week. Moreno said he ""agrees 100 percent"" with MMDA Chairman Francis Tolentino, noting that Manila is home to 104 elementary and high schools. ""Bakit naman ako hindi mag-a-agree sa pino-propose ni Chairman Tolentino sa DepEd (Department of Education)?"" he said. He said they are also open to the proposal of a 4-day work week in a bid to ease traffic congestion in the city streets. Manila has around 11,000 city hall employees, he said.

2014-09-09,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesWhat began as an uploaded photograph that went viral on social media last week turned out to be a police-orchestrated highway robbery to the tune of P2 million. Nine policemen, including seven assigned to the La Loma police station of the Quezon City Police District (QCPD), have been tagged in a daring abduction and robbery on Edsa on Sept. 1. The crime may not have been brought to public attention if not for a netizen who posted the photo on Twitter. Of the nine lawmen, two were officials and batchmates at the Philippine National Police Academy (PNPA) Class of 2001, according to documents obtained by the Inquirer. The highest-ranking among them, Chief Insp. Joseph de Vera, La Loma station deputy commander, was subjected to inquest proceedings for brigandage or highway robbery and kidnapping with serious illegal detention in the Mandaluyong City Prosecutors Office on Monday. The Eastern Police District (EPD) director, Chief Supt. Abelardo Villacorta, said De Vera, 39, was tagged after it was learned that his silver gray Toyota Hiace Commuter van with conduction sticker YF 9767 was one of four vehicles that blocked a white Toyota Fortuner bearing the two victims. The blue Honda Civic with license plate No. ZJB 149, another vehicle in the viral photo, is owned by former Insp. Marco Polo Estrera, who was dismissed in 2006. Aside from De Vera, also tagged were Senior Insp. Oliver Villanueva, SPO1 Ramil Hachero, PO2 Weavin Masa, PO2 Mark de Paz, PO2 Jerome Datinguinoo, PO2 Ebonn Decatoriaall of the La Loma police station; and PO2 Jonathan Rodriguez of the QCPDs public safety battalion. All the suspects save for Rodriguez were assigned to the La Loma police stations follow-up section as detectives. De Vera was arrested before dawn on Sunday right at the La Loma police station when the National Capital Region Police Office chief, Director Carmelo Valmoria, went to the police station to conduct a regular inspection. It so happened that Villacorta and his team were also at the police station, close on the heels of the policemen who were identified by the two victims, employees of a contractor in Lanao del Sur province. We informed the regional director that we were there to follow up the Sept. 1 incident and we talked to De Vera, Villacorta said. Villacorta had formed a special investigation unit, Task Group Wack-Wack, after the photograph of the incident went viral on social media. At first, De Vera played dumb about the incident but eventually admitted that he and the others carried out an antidrug operation along Edsa, based on a tip from a female informant. However, the police official could not present any coordination papers or even a blotter entry of the supposed arrest, since the victims were set free after losing their money. He maintained that it was an antinarcotics operation and it was not a robbery, Villacorta said. The EPD managed to track down the victims through the previous owner of the white Toyota Fortuner, whose license plate was captured in a surveillance camera footage on Edsa. The previous owner, a businessman in Mindanao, had sold it to a former councilor in Lanao del Sur, who was the victims boss. The victims boss, engineer Cariong Malik, was convinced to persuade his employees to report the incident, which happened at a gas station on Edsas southbound lane, a few hundred meters away from the Philippine National Police headquarters in Camp Crame. We also asked around near the area where it happened. Fortunately, we got some information and it helped a lot in our investigation, Villacorta said. After much prodding, victims Ustadz Samanodin Abdul Gafur and Camal Mama surfaced at the EPD headquarters on Sept. 6. According to the victims, they were in Manila to buy heavy equipment worth P2 million for their boss. A former girlfriend of one of the victims apparently knew about their trip and that they were carrying a huge amount of money. They were at SM Mall of Asia to meet their contact when the woman called them, asking them to meet them at SM North Edsa. They arrived at the mall and then they got a call from the representative, saying he was already at SM MOA, Villacorta said. While cruising along the southbound lane of Edsa in Mandaluyong City around 2:45 p.m. on Sept. 1, they were waylaid by three vehicles and a motorcycle, after which around 10 armed men were seen pointing their guns at them. One of the policemen, who turned out to be De Vera, was seen smashing the rear windshield of the white Toyota Fortuner. A motorist photographed the incident and uploaded it on Twitter. Villacorta said the victims were brought to the La Loma police station where they were held for seven hours in two offices on the first and second floors. They were told to pretend to be policemen so as not to arouse suspicion. The whole while, they were held without being told if they were being charged and what the offense was, the EPD director said. Aside from the P2 million, the victims ATM cards were seized by the suspects, who withdrew a total of P119,000. They were eventually released at 9 p.m. that day after the policemen had the broken windshield of their white Toyota Fortuner repaired on Banawe Street, Quezon City. They were even threatened by the policemen not to report the incident, or else they will be killed. They were initially hesitant to come to us, Villacorta said. The vehicles of Estrera and De Vera were identified in the incident after images from surveillance cameras on Edsa were enhanced to show the license plate numbers. The EPD went to the La Loma police station before dawn on Sunday to confront the policemen, but only chanced upon De Vera, who was the officer in charge at that time. Valmoria was also at the station to conduct an inspection when the arresting team arrived. During the interrogation, De Vera initially denied any knowledge of the incident but eventually admitted that his group had carried out an antinarcotics operation. However, Villacorta said the supposed operation was not coordinated with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA). There was no spot report or record in the police blotter. It was De Vera who listed on a piece of paper the names of his eight other cohorts, maintaining all the while that it was a legitimate operation brought on by a female tipster. We believe that this female tipster is the woman the victims were talking to prior to the incident. We are considering this woman as a possible suspect, Villacorta said. In the press conference, the EPD detailed the participation of those involved:  Villanueva was purportedly the owner and driver of the Fortuner also photographed in the incident.  Hachero was the man in green who seemed to be pointing a gun at the victims car.  Rodriguez was aboard Villanuevas car.  Masa, De Paz, Datinguinoo and Decatoria participated in the detention of the victims in the La Loma police station. Rodriguez was arrested on Monday afternoon by tracker teams, said the QCPD director, Chief Supt. Richard Albano. We do not condone this kind of brazen acts. We are looking into the administrative and criminal records of these policemen and they will not go unpunished, he said. Albano said the QCPD Station 1-La Loma commander, Supt. Osmundo de Guzman, had been sacked from his post. Albano said he relieved De Guzman on Thursday last week for command responsibility in the case which implicated his men. Whether he knew about it or not, it is still his responsibility being the station commander, Albano said. Valmoria, for his part, said it was trying for them to arrest their fellow policemen but the job had to be done. It pains us. But we cannot let them go just because we are colleagues. We cannot choose who not to arrest and who to arrest, he added. The seven policemen led by Villanueva are still at large and have failed to report for duty despite orders from the higher command. Ever since I took office, I enjoined them  if youre going to do something like this, get out of Quezon City because you have no place here. You will have nowhere else to go but jail, an exasperated Albano said, as he assured that he had sent a tracker team after the police officers still at large. Albano also said he had ordered the relief of the station commanders of the Novaliches-based QCPD Station 4 and the Cubao-based Station 7, respectively, Supt. Norberto Babagay and Supt. Ramon Pranada, for high crime rates in their areas. We have a weekly [analysis] on crime trends, occurrences, patrol plans. And weekly, the assessment [on their stations] have not been favorable, Albano said in Filipino. Last week, the Novaliches police operations head, Chief Insp. Roderick Medrano, was gunned down in front of his family. The QCPD solved the case in two days with the arrest of four alleged hired guns. De Guzman will be replaced by Supt. Dionisio Bartolome, former head of the QCPD special operations group; Pranada will be replaced by Supt. Wilson de los Santos; and Babagay will be replaced by Supt. Eleazar Matta, formerly the commander of the QCPD-Station 6 based in Batasan. Supt. Segundo Lagundi Jr., former head of Task Force Commonwealth, will take over as Batasan station commander.

2014-09-09,,,," MANILA - Light traffic along the North Luzon Expressway (NLEX) and main highways leading to the port of Manila on Monday surprised motorists who experienced a last Friday. This came as a surprise to some motorists as the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) also started to implement its ''last mile'' truck routes. These routes will allow cargo trucks taking express trade lanes to complete the delivery of goods to their designated end-point in case they are caught on the road outside their travel window. About 600 trucks were given stickers for the new policy, allowing them to travel even during the truck ban periods. The MMDA earlier said it expects the scheme to along NLEX, appealing to the public to bear with the new measure that aims to help decongest the Manila port. However, Department of Public Works and Highways Secretary Rogelio Singson explained that the only reason why traffic was light on Monday is because only few trucks travel during weekends until Tuesday. Singson still expects the heavy flow of traffic on Thursday and Friday. Cabinet Secretary Jose Rene Almendras blamed the gridlock last Friday on the single truck lane policy, saying ""some mayors said they did not authorize and order such, but apparently some people decided they wanted the single truck lane."" However, MMDA chairman Francis Tolentino denied that the policy was to be blamed for the monstrous traffic jam, since the policy is only applicable along C-5.","-- Report from Maan Macapagal, ABS-CBN News",ABS-CBNnews.com,Metropolitan Manila Development Authority,yes,2014-09-09 00:00:00,reports on traffic congestion,,,,,,,,english,,http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/09/08/14/light-nlex-traffic-mmda-starts-last-mile-routes,,manila,text,,515.0,,982.0,,pia,,,traffic congestion,5.0,Straight News,,,,,,abs-cbnnews,no,,,,,Light NLEX traffic as MMDA starts 'last mile' routes,,,

2014-09-09,,,,"Senate Majority Leader Alan Peter Cayetano on Tuesday blamed the traffic problem in Metro Manila on the government's National Capital Region-centric policy as he pushed for massive infusion of resources and infrastructure funds to other regions.  Cayetano said the government should initiate the development of provinces now to allow them to grow and create opportunities for their residents.  The answer given to us when we ask for solutions to solve congestion in Metro Manila is to build, build, and build; more, more, and more,"" he said in a press statement.  ""That is what makes it ridiculous. If you have a house na punong-puno na, ang tama bang sagot ay hatiin ang kwarto? Hindi ba ang solusyon is to buy another house o palakihin mo ang lote mo? he added.  Cayetano said while billions of pesos are being lost due to traffic in the National Capital Region every day, other regions in the country continue to experience slow development.  There are 19,137 Filipinos per square kilometer in Metro Manila. Ganoon kadami ang tao dito. Ang pinakamalapit na bilang ay sa Calabarzon, which only has 758 people per sq.km. The rest, ang average is around 300 per sq.km. Karamihan nasa Metro Manila na, he said.  The solution to decongesting Metro Manila ay hindi ang pinapakita sa telebisyon na mga bagong kalye, bagong Skyway. Hindi 'yun ang solusyon. Lalo lang sisikip ang NCR. Ang solusyon ay gawin ang mga projects na 'yan sa labas ng Metro Manila, Cayetano added.  He said that based on the data from the Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers of the Philippines Inc. (CAMPI), around 230,000 to 250,000 vehicles will be purchased in the country next year, 58 percent of which will be filling up the already-congested streets of Metro Manila.  100,000 new cars entered this year in Metro Manila. Add the 100,00 next year, for a total of 2.2 million vehicles in Metro Manila every year na gumagala, kaya traffic,"" he said.  He added that this shows it is not the provincial buses that cause traffic in Metro Manila.  ""Hindi dahil sa [provincial] buses kung hindi sa dami ng sasakyan. So how would we get inclusive growth? Bakit kasi sa Metro Manila lang (ang pinapaunlad)? he said.  Cayetano said that a more feasible solution to decongest NCR is to allot more funds for infrastructure programs in other regions to encourage people to consider moving and looking for employment opportunities outside the capital.  He said that many Filipino families are robbed of opportunities because the biggest chunk of the national budget pie is allocated to NCR.  The senator said in 2013 alone, the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) approved P184.2 billion worth of 10 major infrastructure projects, eight of which are located in NCR.  He said the two other projects are the Bulacan Bulk Water Supply Project worth P24.4 billion and Mactan Cebu International Airport Expansion at P17.5 billion.  Cayetano said this stressed the need for government to promote a more inclusive economic plan that will allow the implementation of a specific economic strategy for each of the 17 regions.  There is no one cure, there is no one-size-fits-all. Kapag nag-economic planning tayo, dapat may national vision; may coherent policy. Pero dapat may 17 regional strategies kung saan ang bawat region ay may strategy at mabibigyan ng pera, he said.",AMITA LEGASPI,,,yes,2014-09-09 00:00:00,reports on traffic congestion,,,,,,,,english,,http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/378338/news/nation/govt-s-ncr-centric-policy-led-to-traffic-sen-alan-peter-cayetano,,"cebu, metro manila, bulacan, manila",text,,764.0,,38.0,,pia,,,traffic congestion,4.5,Straight News,,,,,,gmanetwork,no,,,,,Govts NCR-centric policy led to traffic Sen.

2014-09-11,,die:12,,"BAGUIO CITY, PhilippinesEfren Dalisdis went to Poblacion National High School in Buguias town in Benguet province in his old Ford Fiera jeepney on Tuesday afternoon to fetch his 16-year-old son, John Ray. On their way home, John Rays schoolmates hitched a ride. It is common in the vegetable-growing community for students to walk to and from school each day on the Buguias-Kabayan Road. Motoristssome of them on their way back from the days vegetable deliveriesoften give the students a ride to keep them safe. But Tuesday was not one of those moments. Dalisdis vehicle, carrying 15 students aged 12 to 18, fell into a 100-meter deep ravine at 4:30 p.m. in Sitio (settlement) Bangbangayen, Barangay (village) Poblacion, killing him, his son and 11 others. Reports from the Buguias police and the Office of Civil Defense (OCD) in the Cordillera region said eight died instantly, including the 45-year-old Dalisdis. Four others, including John Ray, died while being taken to Abatan Lutheran Hospital (ALH) in the town. Charee Bestre, 15, was taken to Baguio General Hospital and Medical Center in Baguio City (BGHMC) but was transferred to Saint Louis Universitys Hospital of Sacred Heart here, where she died early Wednesday. The other fatalities were Jeribeth Simeon, 12; Maricel Basatan and Ivonne Bestre, both 13; Jera Flair Mayao, Jera Madiano, Jasmin Lestino, Angie Aguien, Meljoy Agustin, all of them 15; and Nenerva Menzi and Mari Faith Lamsis, both 16. Rescue teams took survivors Jamerose Bankin, 15, and Reyshan Latuwed, 18, to BGHMC, while Elejoy Agyapas, 17, was taken to ALH. In Buguias, residents said three other children would have been among the victims had they boarded the jeepney. Witnesses said they saw the vehicle of Dalisdis stop for three more children who were walking home, but it stalled. The jeepney then rolled off the road and fell into the ravine, said Mina Bela-o, a Buguias resident, in a telephone interview on Wednesday. The accident shocked residents of Buguias, about 50 kilometers from this city, because even bus and jeepney drivers take time to pick up students walking on the road, Bela-o said. Brillante Madayag, a Land Transportation Office employee, said the practice of motorists accommodating children for their safety was common in upland towns in the Cordillera. You can often see children walking home along the Halsema Highway, and buses stop for them because their houses are usually just a few kilometers down the road, said Madayag, who was at BGHMC to investigate the accident. Taking care of children is a community duty in Buguias, and many parents are assured of their childrens safety knowing that the uncles and aunties driving through the town would pick them up, relatives of Latuwed and Bankin told the Inquirer. I used to hitch a ride when I was their age, said one of Latuweds aunts. Latuwed suffered a head injury but her relatives and the police were able to talk to her at BGHMC. Bankin, whose left foot was broken, was resting when the Inquirer visited her on Wednesday morning.

2014-09-13,,,"Vehicle users, Government agencies","A new traffic scheme that the Metro Manila Development Authority is implementing on Katipunan Avenue in Quezon City is being blamed for a spate of accidents in the area in front of Ateneo de Manila University and Miriam College. According to a report from GMA's 24-Oras program on Saturday, a vehicle and a motorcycle collided on Katipunan around 2 p.m. There were also numerous motorcycle mishaps, including one involving a rider who was flung from his motorcycle after being told to stop by MMDA personnel. Nagkaroon ng minor accident primarily due to the stoplight. Vehicles traveling in this route are used to a go-go traffic flow, frequent Katipunan motorist Eric Tan explained. Aside from the signalized traffic system, four U-turn slots were closed to reduce heavy traffic on Katipunan. The MMDA has closed the U-turn slots located at Gate 2.5 of the Ateneo de Manila University, the two back-to-back U-turn slots in front of Miriam College and the one in front of Miriam Grade School. Karugtong ito nung efforts natin sa C-5. Iisa lang naman direksyon ng C-5 hanggang Katipunan, so ang purpose nito i-signalize na lahat nang sa gayon mawala na 'yung mga nagbubuntis na U-turn slots, MMDA Chairman Atty. Francis Tolentino said. He also said while the number of vehicles on Katipunan cannot be reduced, the new scheme will make the flow of traffic more orderly. ""Predictable. Alam mo kung ilang seconds ka pa maghihintay. Alam mo na may left turn doon. 'Di tulad ng dati na on your own ka,"" he said. The designated U-turn slots under the Aurora flyover and near C.P. Garcia Avenue are still open. Meanwhile, trucks are allowed to ply Katipunan's truck discipline lane from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. Mondays through Saturdays. The MMDA for its part said they will observe the new system and will make necessary adjustments to further reduce heavy traffic in Katipunan Avenue.

2014-09-13,,,Manila City Mayor,"MANILA - Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada has lifted the truck ban in the city indefinitely to give way to the national government's efforts to ease congestion in the ports. In a press conference on Saturday morning, Estrada said the lifting of the truck ban is effective 12 noon today, pursuant to Executive Order No. 67. Estrada said the city decided to lift the truck ban to give the national government the free hand to address congestion in the ports. ""We understand that the national government is confident that it can solve the problem of the port congestion within the few months in time for the holiday season,"" he told reporters. The truck ban in Manila has been blamed by some sectors for the port congestion. But according to Estrada, port congestion has been present even before the city implemented the truck ban. ""Matagal na pong may port congestion. Hindi po truck ban ang sanhi nito. Mabuti nga po ngayon ay alam na ng taongbayan ang problema ng port congestion,"" he said. He also noted that residents of Manila have benefited from the truck ban, as it eased traffic in the city's roads. Nonetheless, the mayor said they are now leaving it to the national government to handle the traffic situation in the city. The government has already formed Task Force Pantalan to spearhead the decongestion of traffic near Manila ports. Estrada, however, stressed that nobody pressured them to lift the truck ban. ""In fairness, they have not pressured us. We did this voluntarily. At in fairness to the President, hindi naman kami sinisisi, yung mga truckers lang ang nagsisisi sa amin,"" he said. ""I am avoiding conflict kaya we withdraw and let the national government take over."" He added that they may still choose to enforce the truck ban again depending on the outcome of the new measure. Meanwhile, Manila Vice Mayor and traffic czar Isko Moreno admitted that he and Estrada were also hurt that the city's truck ban was blamed for the congestion in the ports. Moreno said they were just doing their jobs of protecting the welfare of their constituents. ""Hindi mo maiaalis, kami ni Pangulong-Mayor Erap ay may sama ng loob. Bakit naman hindi? Eh tao rin kami,"" he said. But he said they are now setting their grievances aside as a sign of cooperation with the national government. Moreno, however, still took potshots at the national government. ""Kung sa tingin po naman ng mga higit na nakakataas sa amin at mahalaga yung iba pang bagay higit sa mga buhay na pinangangalagaan namin sa lungsod ng Maynila, then the President-Mayor gave them free hand. Baka po mas magaling sila sa amin."" ""Baka po mas kabisado nila na pag ala-una ng madaling araw may paparadang truck sa gitna ng kalye at may mamamatay na isang kapitbahay namin dahil nabangga nung truck na iniwan ng truck driver. Baka po mas kabisado nila na yung truck sasagasaan yung center island para makapag-U-turn at pag nawalan ng balanse ay tataob na yung container,"" he said. ""Baka kasi dun sila nakatira kaya mas magandang sila ang mamahala. Baka dun sila lumaki, sila na ang mamahala,"" he added. The vice mayor said he is hoping that with the lifting of the truck ban, the city of Manila will no longer be blamed for the monstrous traffic being experienced in other parts of Metro Manila. ""Sana hindi na masisi ang Maynila sa traffic sa Katipunan, traffic sa EDSA, traffic sa Paraaque, traffic sa Caloocan,"" he said. Moreno also appealed to their constituents to observe road safety now that more trucks will be out on the road.

2014-09-14,,,,"Can Metro Manilas traffic woes ever disappear? The National Academy of Science and Technology asked me that question at its 36th Annual Scientific Meeting on July 9. For harassed Metro Manila commuters, it is a question begging for an answeryesterday. Our traffic congestion has become world-class in a pejorative sensealthough it did not appear on Forbes list of 10 most congested cities in the world. By its metric, an average of eight hours lost by every person in a year was extremely bad. To us, that would be heaven as each person lost an average of 300 hours yearly due to traffic congestion. When it comes to traffic, everybody becomes an ersatz expertlike the proverbial three blind men feeling different parts of an elephant. You can hear solutions, such as effective traffic enforcement, more traffic discipline, more roads, fewer buses and the phaseout of jeepneys. Not all suggestions are misplaced, for there is no magic wand to crack the traffic congestion nut. Lessons from other cities have shown a multitude of congestion antidotes. These are either supply-side solutions, demand-side or both. Building more roads belongs to the first category. So does more Light Rail Transits (LRTs) or Metro Rail Transits (MRTs). On the other hand, limiting the number of vehicles on the road via the number-coding scheme or the truck ban belongs to the second. Singapore is a good example of how traffic congestion can be tamed. Starting in the 1970s, the Lion City put into motion a comprehensive set of measures. In 1984, it did not have a single kilometer of rail transit when Manilas LRT 1 opened for business. To date, Singapore has 153 km of mass transit lines and 161 km of urban expressways. In addition, it reformed an antiquated bus transport system, adopted a road pricing scheme and imposed a tax that discouraged car ownership. But we cannot just import solutions as many foreign experts advise us to do. Adaptation to local conditions is a must. Metro Manila has its peculiarities and similarities with other urban centers. It does not have enough roads (14 percent of the countrys total) to accommodate 7.2 million motor vehicles (56 percent of the countrys). Metro Manila has nearly two times more vehicles per km of road than Singapore. This is compounded by a population density that is even higher than that of Tokyo metropolis (19,126 persons per square kilometer; Tokyo, around 14,390, and Singapore, around 7,100). The usual prescription is to build more roadsa task the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) likes to pursue, albeit with little success. It is hampered by a time-consuming process of buying right-of-way. One court decision in the 1980s made a vital artery, C3, incomplete to this day. Several important flyovers are bogged down by a rabid Nimby (not-in-my-backyard) syndrome, if not by roadblocks from other government agencies. Increasing road capacity is no match for vehicle population growth. Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers of the Philippines Inc. expects its sales to go up by 24 percent this year. Besides, a new road begets only more traffic. The most basic solution is to optimize road utilization. Roads throughout the metropolis should be maximizedin terms of more vehicles per hour and more people per hour per lane. How can this be achieved? Through traffic engineering and management measures such as the signalization of intersections, road geometric improvements, imposition of no-parking zones, removal of on-road and on-sidewalk market stalls, and faithful compliance with designated loading and unloading points by buses and jeepneys. These are mission impossible for the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) and its 17 local government units, whose personnel scarcely know traffic rules. Smart signaling in which a network of traffic signals is controlled by a computer system is the most efficient method to road productivity. It does not get tired, unlike traffic cops. The more intersections tied to the system are signalized, the more effective optimization becomes. It was a program started by the DPWH in 1977 and progressively expanded. By the end of 2000, the system had expanded to cover 435 intersections. From 2003 to 2010, however, many intersections were designalized in favor of accident-prone U-turn schemes. Fortunately, it seems that the MMDA has finally awokenif the return of signalization on C-5 is any indication. Moving a larger volume of people on our limited road network can be achieved by improving our entire public transport system. The different modes have to behave like a family member, complementing each others strengths rather than elbowing each other on the streets. Expanding the urban rail transit network is a must. But our government has dillydallied on this challenge. The three LRT lines are managed poorlywith Line 3 on Edsa as the poster boy of flawed rail policies and mismanagement. In 2012, rail grabbed a 14.2-percent market share, good but for the wrong reason: a decade-old stagnant fare regime, a popular policy that is actually antipoor. Investing more money in the railway system is like throwing money into the drainunless the right policy regime is put in place. The free-for-all operations of buses and jeepneys aggravate traffic congestion. That arrangement needs to be replaced by a new business model of service collaboration. We started the journey of reforming the bus transport system in the late 1970s almost at the same time as Singapore did only to kill the program a few years after. Bus productivity is very low as can be seen along Edsa, where more than 3,500 buses operate half-full and achieve no more than three round trips a day. The MMDA is trying its best to manage the buses on Edsavia such schemes as the organized bus route and bus segregation but these are putative and inutile efforts to solve the bus conundrum. Seoul reformed its bus system only in 2004. Now, Seoul is providing Manila a lesson instead of the other way around. A bigger challenge are the jeepneys (about 60,000 relics of World War II) with their atomized operating structure. They account for 23 percent of daily trips. This Filipino innovation has wallowed in a low-performance equilibrium trap over the past six decades. No innovation. Moving them into the 21st century will require bold action. The government should buy out and replace all of them with green transportbattery-powered, GPS-equipped (and linked to a central operations center) and side-entry, low-floor vehicles with adequate head room for passengers to stand up. This can be financed by the Special Vehicle Pollution Control Fund, which has remained underspent for more than 10 years. It is a bargain compared with the P54-billion buyout plan for the MRT 3, which the Department of Transportation and Communication (DOTC) has been talking about for more than three years. The MRT-3 buyout, if ever it happens, will not even add one train on Edsa nor lift its degraded service. Efficient movement of freights makes a city competitive. Yet, this vital aspect of the urban economy is often ignored. Trucks are often demonized and subjected to more constraints than any other mode. The truck ban is one of the most enduring decongestion measure in Metro Manila, dating back to the 1970s. Trucks are provided a window of time during the day to be on the road, aside from banning them altogether on some streets. A designated truck route provided an open channel to the ports. This modus vivendi got broken in February when the City of Manila enacted an ordinance that narrowed the window. Operations at the North and South Harbors got disrupted, wreaking havoc on the supply chain of many industries. There must be a better way to accommodate trucks on the streets of Metro Manila. We are not lacking in comprehensive plans. The countrys development partners have ensured that. There was the World Bank-funded Metro Manila Transport Land Use and Development Planning Project (MMetroplan) of 1975, which brought about the LRT 1 and the now-forgotten busway on Magsaysay Boulevard. There was the Metro Manila Urban Transport Integrated Study (MMUTIS) in 1998, completed with generous funding from Japan. Unfortunately, not much of them saw the light of day. As a consequence, traffic went from bad to worse, as shown in the infographic, which compares hourly traffic distribution in 2013 with that in 1997. The curve has flattenedmeaning traffic congestion has become a daylong struggle. A recent survey put a number on what happened: Average journey time was 24-percent longer in 2012 than in 1997. Recently crafted, again with assistance from Japan International Cooperation Agency, is the newest game plan in town: a Transport Roadmap for Greater Metro Manila. It is a dream plan to vanish traffic congestion completely by 2030. Through computer simulation, the study was able to quantify the required supply: 137 km of new roads, another 78 km of urban expressways and more than 200 km of new rail transit lines (elevated and underground). It also called for a radical restructuring of the current surface public transport system. It has gotten the nod of President Aquino, but will it survive in the next administration? Perhaps, netizens (see http://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=CJ9F2Fnweuo) can keep the dream alive. Surprisingly, its price tag (about P2.6 trillion) can be afforded. The monkey wrench is the institutional apraxiaan inability to execute projects of the transport kind. For one, the countrys rail institutions are broken and in long need of fixing. Past and present DOTC officials prefer to take the easy way out by kicking the can down the road while Congress has sat on all railway reform bills for more than 10 years. The second agency that needs to carry the battle against traffic congestionthe MMDAis fixated on Edsa, perennially engaged in shadow boxing and unable to let go of a number-coding scheme that has lost its sting. The third agencythe DPWH has shown better nimbleness but is slowed down by obstacles outside its control. Traffic is a humongous problem that cannot be left to the government alone. Everybody must pitch in. Opening select roads in gated subdivisions can be a big help. Up to 20 percent of the road supply in Metro Manila is private. If only a small part of these roads can become accessible to the public, even for a short window of time during the day, dramatic improvements can be felt by all. On the demand side, carpooling can be done without waiting for Godot. The business districts of Makati, Ortigas and Bonifacio Global City can promote car-sharing within office towers, if not office blocks. In these areas, their populations balloon by more than 50 percent during the day. Of course, it will help if they can live within and walk to their jobsbut condominiums closer to workplaces are beyond the means of ordinary workers. School trips comprised more than 15 percent of daily trips. Large colleges and universities can and should encourage carpooling among their students, aside from building more on-campus dormitories. Some enterprising Filipinos launched in February 2012 an online platform for car-sharing that businesses and schools could use. A black swan event, such as a massive earthquake, could finesse institutional rigidities. Rapid diffusion of new technologies, like autonomous cars and smart roads, may put an end to our traffic woes faster than our government agencies can act. To me, getting rid of the jeepney mentality is the icebreaker, the one ring to rule them all. The elevated U-turn slot on C-5 and Kalayaan Avenue is as much a symbol of this Jurassic mentality as the jeepney. Built by the MMDA, it is a structure that flagrantly violates standards of highway engineering. In contrast, about 500 meters south, is a flyover that got built according to global standards. Had Henry Sy remained wedded to the jeepney mentality, SM would still be selling shoes today in Carriedo, Quiapo. Yes, the traffic woes of Metro Manila can disappearbut only if we let go of the heritage of smallness that Nick Joaquin lamented about. Liberated from the jeepney mentality, a new capital to de-imperialize Metro Manila becomes a possibility. That would be the mother of demand-side solutions to end our traffic miseries. (Rene S.

2014-09-14,,,,"Joseph Estrada blinked. Now cargo trucksthose behemoths of the local freight industryare lording it over Manilas roads again. Manila Mayor Joseph Erap Estrada said on Saturday that he stood down to avert a clash between Manila and the national government. So in front of reporters at Diamond Hotel in Manila, Estrada signed his Executive Order No. 67 lifting a seven-month-old ban on cargo trucks that had been blamed for congestion at the Port of Manila, double-digit losses for importers and exporters, food shortages, rising prices of basic goods, horrendous traffic in the metropolis and the threat, at one time, of a P320-billion loss for the Philippine economy, closures and job losses at special economic zones. Estradas order took effect at noon on Saturday, handing victory to the truckers who had fought the ban but lost as the mayor, a former President of the Philippines, stood his ground, insisting on order and discipline on the roads of Manila. But after a metro-wide gridlock and a 9-kilometer traffic tailback on the North Luzon Expressway on Sept. 5, Malacaang intervened, ordering the formation of Task Force Pantalan to oversee traffic management from the metropolitan gate to the expressway to Route 10-Del Pan at the Port of Manila. The task force was composed of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA), the National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) and local governments in the metropolis. It was headed by Chief Supt. Allen Bantolo, deputy director for operations of the NCRPO. It was the operation of the task force that broke Estradas resolve. At the news conference, the mayor said there was no pressure from Malacaang and that his decision was voluntary. But later, he and Vice Mayor Francisco Isko Moreno Domagoso admitted that they felt bad about the national governments response to the truck ban. You cant deny us the right to feel bad. We are just doing our job and that is to solve our citys traffic problems, Domagoso said. We are trying to avoid conflict, Estrada said. There might be a shootout if we dont lift the ban. Domagoso explained: We were intimidated. Imagine bringing in the Armysoldiers in uniform and carrying M16s. Estrada said the city government and the residents of Manila decided to sacrifice their interests and let the national government have its way. Im giving way to the national government under the Office of the President, he said. Estrada and Domagoso hinted that they were passing the responsibility for managing traffic in Manila to Malacaang. We have reached purgatory [with] the truck ban. Now, we [are going] back [to] the gates of hell, Domagoso said. There was no reaction from Malacaang yesterday as all Palace officials were preoccupied with President Aquinos departure for Europe last night. But Communications Secretary Herminio Coloma issued a brief statement, saying the lifting of the truck ban would facilitate cargo movement to and from the Port of Manila, and contribute significantly to the eventual decongestion of the port. Mayor Estradas statesmanlike gesture is commendable, Coloma said. The truck ban prohibited eight-wheelers and cargo vehicles heavier than 4,500 kilos from entering the city between 5 a.m. and 9 p.m. It eased traffic in the city but because of the limited trucking hours, cargo piled up at the Port of Manila. When the truckers and shippers complained, the MMDA introduced a one-lane policy on C5 and Quirino Avenue, and Manila opened an express trade lane on Roxas Boulevard to allow trucks to move across the city outside the ban hours, hasten the removal of freight containers from the port and allow the unloading of fresh cargo coming in from foreign ports. Later, the MMDA also introduced a last mile policy, exempting truckers doing business with the Port of Manila from local truck bans in the metropolis. But those measures and overtime work at the Port of Manila and the Manila International Container Terminal (MICT) allowed by the Bureau of Customs did little to ease the congestion at the port, which is expected to worsen in the coming weeks with the arrival of shipments for the holiday season. Businesses groaned and Sen. Francis Escudero called on President Aquino on Monday to take a direct hand in solving the port congestion. What the President did, Malacaang has not announced. But Estrada called a news conference yesterday and announced his capitulation. MMDA Chair Francis Tolentino thanked Estrada for trying to find solutions to decongest the Port of Manila. Tolentino said he was confident that with the cooperation of all concerned, a return to the conditions before the truck ban could be enforced. He said he would convene the Metro Manila Mayors Special Traffic Committee tomorrow to draw up a traffic plan that would incorporate Manilas efforts at traffic decongestion and the national governments objective of solving the port congestion. The Department of Transportation and Communications welcomed Estradas decision, which it called timely as the Christmas season was drawing nearer. It is very much welcome and we sincerely appreciate Mayor Estradas decision to come on board, Transportation Secretary Joseph Emilio Abaya said. The local and foreign business communities hailed Estradas decision, which they said would be crucial to decongesting the Port of Manila. Business groups, however, want similar decisions from government agencies, which have imposed restrictions that hamper the stabilization of operations at the port. Thats a very important decision, Henry J. Schumacher, vice president for external affairs of the European Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines, said, referring to Estradas order lifting the truck ban. What is needed for addressing the port congestion [and improving] accessibility of the ports is a ban of all bans. But we need a lifting of the franchising of trucks for hire by agencies [under the] Department of Transportation and Communications. All trucks are needed to get full and empty containers out of the ports. Edgardo G. Lacson, president of Employers Confederation of the Philippines, described Estradas decision as a reasonable response to the port congestion, which he said had morphed from a local traffic problem to a national crisis. [We hope that] his gesture can influence other government agencies to start the process of a total and coordinated approach to solve the twin problems of port congestion and traffic mess, Lacson said. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Boards anticolorum rule, the Bureau of Internal Revenues certification requirement for brokers and importers, and the simultaneous Department of Public Works and Highways roadworks need to be harmonized with the schedule of port clearance, he added. Alfredo M. Yao, president of Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said in a text message that Estradas decision would be a big help. But looking forward, the port problem should have a final solution, which is to expand the Subic and Batangas ports so that companies would not need to rely only on the limited capacity of the Manila port. And, of course, our infrastructure projects should be fast-tracked and backed with political will, Yao said. Sergio R. Ortiz-Luis Jr., president of Philippine Exporters Confederation Inc., said he believed that Estrada just decided to cooperate with the national government. I dont think he is doing this because he thinks the truck ban is a problem. He is just cooperating so that everybody will move, Ortiz-Luis said in a telephone interview. This is a good move and at least now, there are no reasons [why] this issue cannot be done or resolved. Lets see now how fast the government can do this, he said. International Container Terminal Services Inc. (ICTSI), which operates the MICT, also welcomed Estradas decision but said more needed to be done. This ban lifting is a major step but only the first of many. What we need to do now is shorten the time it takes to totally solve the issue by ensuring everyone is working for the same thing. We need to set aside individual interests and focus on joint solutions, Christian Gonzales, ICTSI vice president and Asia Region head, said in a text message. Gonzales said he had called port users to a meeting tomorrow to put together a decongestion plan under the new conditions set by this truck ban lifting. RELATED STORIES",Nia P.

2014-09-15,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesCommuters headed for Katipunan Avenue in Quezon City should brace themselves for changes in the flow of traffic in the area. Starting last Saturday, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) closed down four U-turn slots between the Aurora flyover and C.P. Garcia and activated traffic lights near Ateneo de Manila University Gate 3 and Miriam College Gate 1. It also started implementing the one-lane truck policy on the whole stretch of the thoroughfare. In an advisory, the MMDA said that a green light at the traffic signal near Ateneo Gate 3 would simultaneously apply to vehicles on the southbound lane going to Aurora Boulevard or turning right to F. B. de la Rosa as well as motorists in the opposite lane going to UP Balara or turning right to Ateneo Gate 3. When the red light flashes on the northbound lane toward UP Balara, vehicles coming from C. P. Garcia can turn left to Ateneo Gate 3. The MMDA said that a green light would apply simultaneously to vehicles from F. B. de la Rosa turning left to UP Balara northbound as well as those from Ateneo Gate 3 turning left to Aurora Boulevard southbound. However, vehicles coming from Ateneo Gate 3 would not be allowed to cross the intersection toward F.B. de la Rosa and should take the nearest U-turn at C.P. Garcia. For those on the southbound lane, they should take the nearest U-turn slot under the Aurora flyover. For the traffic signal near Miriam College, a green light will simultaneously apply to motorists on the southbound lane headed to Aurora Boulevard or turning right to Gonzalez Street as well as for vehicles in the opposite lane bound for UP Balara or turning right to Miriam College gate. Vehicles on the southbound side coming from C.P. Garcia will be allowed to turn left to the Miriam College entrance gate when the traffic light on the opposite lane (toward UP Balara) turns red. The opening of the traffic lights on Katipunan, according to the MMDA, was one of the agencys solutions to ease heavy traffic in the area which was partly blamed on the numerous U-turn slots in the area. It was also in preparation for the opening of the truck lane on the whole stretch of the road, a move implemented on C-5 on Sept. 1 which, according to the MMDA, has improved traffic on the busy thoroughfare.",,"4:18 AM | Monday, September 15th, 2014",,yes,2014-09-15 00:00:00,"reports on traffic congestion,traffic advisories,traffic management schemes",,,,,,,,english,,http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/638014/mmda-implements-changes-in-traffic-flow-on-katipunan,,"aurora, quezon, quezon city, manila",text,,639.0,,667.0,,pia,,,traffic congestion,5.0,-,,,,,,inquirer,no,,,,,MMDA implements changes in traffic flow on Katipunan  | Inquirer News,,,
2014-09-16,,,,"I fully agree with the views and vision of former transportation undersecretary Glicerio Sicat as presented by Cielito F. Habito in his column More railways in our future (Opinion, 8/19/14). Indeed the burgeoning daytime population of Metro Manila can no longer be accommodated by the present commuter transport systems in place, as evidenced by the daily gridlock in the metros main roadways. A subway system may be the answer. As a matter of fact, as early as the 1970s a feasibility study of an underground line was prepared by a Japanese consulting company but it was vetoed by the First Lady and Metro Manila Commission governor, Imelda Marcos. The Philippine National Railways, of which I am a 42-year veteran, had its own plans to mitigate the traffic situation. Foremost was the Malolos-Calamba Commuter Line Project, which called for double-tracking the Malolos-Caloocan and Sucat-Calamba sections. But events intervened and the section from Malolos to Caloocan was ceded to the so-called Northrail Project, which proved to be a colossal failure 20 years and billions of pesos later. Then the present Department of Transportation and Communications downgraded the Sucat-Calamba section to remain just single-tracked, effectively dooming the PNRs dream of a high-density commuter service from the dormitory villages north and south of Metro Manila. The single-tracked line also doomed the revival of the International Container Terminal Services Inc.s container trains from the Manila International Container Terminal to Calamba, which would serve the Calabarzon area since the single tracks cannot accommodate commuter and container trains. In retrospect, the ICTSI trains could have prevented the present rows on the inability of moving out the incoming containers and the resulting congestion of the terminals. Had the present dispensation been more selective with the staffing of the existing DOTC top echelon, its projects would have been unrolled without delay. Some projects come to mind: the interconnection of LRT1 and MRT3, single ticketing system, extension of LRT1 to Cavite, procurement of additional trains for MRT3, and the combined LRT1 and MRT3 terminal, to name just a few of those projects dealing with the movement of commuters. President Aquino still has 22 months in office, and if cares to, he can put the right people in one of the worst-performing agencies, the DOTC. RAMON J.

2014-02-24,,,,"MANILA - If Malacaang can have its way, truckers should not be banned in the streets of Metro Manila, especially at a time when the economy is booming. Secretary Herminio Coloma Jr. of the Presidential Communications Operations Office said this was the position taken by Public Works and Highways Secretary Rogelio Singson, who has been coordinating with the city government of Manila to reconsider its ordinance on daytime truck ban. Starting today, eight-wheeler trucks are prohibited from traveling the citys streets from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. Violators of the truck ban will be fined P5,000 and their vehicles impounded. We have a very high GDP (gross domestic product) growth because of our export and import, Coloma said. We have to help our exporters, importers and the truckers to move around and consider as well the effects of our infrastructure projects, like the Skyway Stage 3, which started just a week ago, he added. Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) Chairman Francis Tolentino announced yesterday what he called a win-win solution for the local government of Manila and the truckers. Tolentino said Mayor Joseph Estrada had agreed to lengthen the window time from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. The city government of Manila conceded to the requests of truckers and exporters to modify its daytime truck ban. From an outright ban of trucks during daytime, Manila will now allow trucks to enter the city during a five-hour window, from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Cargo trucks and cement mixers are included in the ban. On the other hand, haulers carrying perishable goods, oil tankers, and trucks used for government projects are exempted from the ban. But these will have to get permits from the Manila Traffic and Parking Bureau before they will be allowed to pass through the city streets. The ordinance was originally set for implementation on Feb. 4 but was postponed due to calls from truck owners and operators to review the truck ban. Tolentino said the new window time would give truck drivers an additional two hours to travel in the city. Truck owners and operators had earlier threatened to go on holiday to oppose the truck ban. Tolentino said they are still studying the city governments plan to allow trucks to pass through Roxas Boulevard as this is expected to create traffic jams in the area. Meanwhile, the Port Users Confederation (PUC) yesterday said the 10 p.m. to 3 p.m. window period is not enough for truckers to pick up their cargo from the Manila International Container Terminal and South Harbor. Thats too short for trucks to enter the city and haul containers out of the ports, said Rodolfo de Ocampo, president of PUC and the Confederation of Truckers Association of the Philippines. He said the implementation of the daytime truck ban will disrupt operations at the two ports. We are not sending out our trucks on Monday. But we are not staging a boycott. Its really not possible to send out a truck to haul containers within that window. Sayang lang ang krudo (Its just a waste of fuel), De Ocampo told The STAR in a phone interview. Caloocan Mayor Oscar Malapitan yesterday said the City Council is set to pass a resolution banning cargo trucks from entering the city. The council will pass a resolution on Tuesday that would effectively implement a truck ban in the city, particularly in the Dagat-Dagatan area, Malapitan told The STAR. He said the city is bent on following Manilas truck ban out of necessity because if we dont, we will be bearing the load. Cargo trucks going to Port Area in Manila pass through Dagat-Dagatan Avenue and C-3 Road, creating traffic congestion in the area. Meanwhile, an administration lawmaker recommended to the Bureau of Customs (BOC) to shift cargo traffic from Manila to the Batangas port to help ease traffic congestion due to ongoing major road construction in the metropolis. Batangas Rep. Raneo Abu said the BOC should seriously consider this option to lessen the volume of trucks traveling along major thoroughfares in Metro Manila. If the BOC issues an administrative order stating that all Calabarzon (Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal and Quezon) bound shipments will only be processed in Batangas port then the cargo volume will naturally shift there, he said. Abu said the Port of Batangas is so far the only Customs office in the country that is ISO certified, which proves its world-class capability of handling and processing shipment transactions. Based on data submitted by the International Container Terminal Services Inc. to the PPA in June 2013, 66 percent of cargo volume that pass through the Manila International Container Terminal are bound for Calabarzon. Laguna-bound shipment accounted for 43 percent of the total cargo in 2012, with shipments bound for San Pedro, Sta. Rosa, Canlubang and Calamba. Batangas accounted for 15 percent and the remaining eight percent for Cavite. In our last committee hearing, PPA reported a mere four percent utilization of the Batangas container terminal. This gross underutilization of a facility built using a P5.5-billion loan from the Japanese government is an injustice to the government due to loss of revenue and the people of Batangas as they are deprived of livelihood opportunities, Abu said. Batangas port has modern facilities and adequate road infrastructure from Manila to Batangas, Abu said.

2014-09-24,,,,"BAGUIO CITYRelatives of victims of a Sept. 9 vehicular accident in Buguias town in Benguet province shared the pain of losing their loved ones with Interior Secretary Manuel Mar Roxas II on Monday. Upon the instructions of President Benigno Aquino III, who is in the United States for several official engagements, Roxas went to Baguio with presidential spokesperson Edwin Lacierda to condole with the families of the 12 high school students who died after the jeepney they were riding fell into a ravine. The families were taken to a Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) facility here by personnel from the office of Benguet Rep. Ronald Cosalan. Roxas gave the families of each victim a P108,000 check from the Office of the President. The 13th fatality was Efren Dalisdis, the father of one of the victims and who was driving the Ford Fiera that fell into the 100-meter ravine. Dalisdis picked up his son, John Ray, from Poblacion (Buguias) National High School and allowed the other students to hitch a ride with them. Among the parents who met Roxas was Leonora Dalisdis, widow of Dalisdis and mother of John Ray. Benguet Gov. Nestor Fongwan told Roxas that Efren Dalisdis, like many Buguias motorists, had picked up the students, some of whom would have hiked for more than a kilometer to reach home. [Dalisdis actions] that day was well-meaning, Fongwan said. But the accident left many Buguias families in shock, said Jaime Pulano, village chief of Amlimay where many of the victims lived. We in the community now think it will be better if our children just walk home, Pulano said. He said walking was common in the area because public transport was scarce. Residents said students often hitched a ride with buses and jeepneys or trucks driven by farmers who return to the town after delivering their crops to the Benguet capital of La Trinidad. Pulano said many of the families tended vegetable gardens for a living, but work had stopped even after they buried their children. They seem lost, he said.

""The scheme will be beneficial to the public as it will redound to lesser volume of commuters, pedestrians and volume of vehicles in our road networks,"" he said. Under the new scheme, government offices in Metro Manila can voluntarily implement it from Tuesday to Friday or Monday to Thursday. Employees covered by the scheme will be required to work from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m., taking an hour off for their lunch break.

2014-09-27,,,,"Transport groups in Metro Manila renewed calls for the suspension of a government order that raised fines to as high as P1 million for franchise violations, a measure already being challenged in the Supreme Court but which remains open for discussion at the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). Were not against the law but where are the other government actions to help us so we can avoid violations? said Efren de Luna, national chair of the Alliance of Concerned Transport Organization (Acto), during a consultation held at the Land Transportation Office (LTO) in Quezon City on Friday. De Luna said some areas covered by their jeepney franchises, for example, had become private properties, forcing operators to find routes and run the risk of being apprehended for being out-of-line. Other drivers unknowingly commit violations on streets that lack proper traffic signs, such as those for loading and unloading areas, making them easy prey for extortionist traffic officers, De Luna added. Lets have a moratorium while we modify the franchises and install traffic signs, said the Acto chair. Other representatives from the truck, taxi and bus sectors were one in protesting the increased penalties for traffic and franchise violations under Joint Administrative Order (JAO) No. 2014-01 issued in June by the LTFRB, LTO and the Department of Transportation and Communications. The JAO slaps first-time offenders with a P1-million fine for colorum or unauthorized buses, P200,000 for trucks and vans, P50,000 for jeepneys and P120,000 for cars. A third offense will lead to the cancellation of franchise of the operators whole fleet. Days after issuing the order, the LTFRB decided to suspend up to Oct. 17 the implementation of specific JAO provisions penalizing colorum vehicles nationwide. But in July, that suspension was lifted in Metro Manila. For George San Mateo of Piston (Pagkakaisa ng mga Samahan ng Tsuper at Opereytor Nationwide), the JAO seemed to be premised on the assumption that public utility vehicles (PUVs) should get the most blame for the daily traffic congestion. Yet Congressional hearings had shown that PUVs occupy only 20 percent of the road network while servicing 80 percent of the passengers, he said. On the other hand, private vehicles occupy 80 percent of the road while moving only 20 percent of passengers, San Mateo added. Quezon City Councilor Bong Suntay, who attended Fridays dialogue as president of the Philippine National Taxi Operators Association, said the penalties should be rationalized in such a way that only individual violators are punished and not entire businesses. The consultation was conducted by the LTFRB and the LTO, the first represented by Board Member Ariel Inton, who was tasked by LTFRB Chair Winston Ginez to get the transport groups position on the JAO and make recommendations. The JAO is being opposed in petitions currently pending in the Supreme Court. One of the petitioners, the National Confederation of Transport Workers Union, called the measure unconstitutional and extortionate, saying the agencies that issued it had no legislative powers to raise the fines.",Erika Sauler,"8:45 AM | Saturday, September 27th, 2014","LTFRB, Philippine National Taxi Operators Association, Alliance of Concerned Transport Organization Acto, National Confederation of Transport Workers Union, Piston Pagkakaisa ng mga Samahan ng Tsuper at Opereytor Nationwide",yes,2014-09-27 00:00:00,"enforcement of existing lawsordinances,colorum fines,puv fines",,,,,,,,english,,http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/640954/ltfrb-pressed-anew-on-stiff-colorum-fines,,"quezon, metro manila, san mateo, quezon city, manila",text,,470.0,,1037.0,,candice,,,"colorum, traffic enforcement and violations",5.5,Straight News,,,,,,inquirer,no,,,,,LTFRB pressed anew on stiff colorum fines | Inquirer News,Neutral,,
2014-09-27,,,,"The horrific traffic nightmare that is Edsa is caused by too many cars and buses. If we can ease the traffic by initially cutting down the number of buses, allowing only the newer and air-conditioned ones, and letting bus operators ply their route without traffic, many motorists might be persuaded to leave their cars at home. It has been established that there are too many half-empty buses on Edsa, and this can only mean: fierce competition for passengers; buses waiting for passengers, making every street corner a virtual terminal; and buses wriggling in and out of their designated lanes to chase after passengers, thus occupying two or three lanes instead of one. The solution will sound simple to many: Remove competition for passengers, cut down the number of buses by half, and reserve one lane exclusively for them. All these can probably be done by installing a modified BRT (Bus Rapid Transit) system using the present participants, their buses and their employees. As soon as the Department of Science and Technologys road trains become available, maybe in one or two years, several of these can be added for an Edsa-only route. But before we even try to lay out the suggested solution, some caveats:  For quick implementation, we must get the cooperation of the present operators/franchise holders.  We should use the present buses as much as possible, or at least the newer half of them.  It should involve as many of the present bus drivers and conductors as possible in order to ensure their continuing employment.  The location and design of the bus stops should make it difficult for bus drivers and passengers to load/unload just anywhere. The suggested solution, which we may call Solution 8+1, is to follow the proposal of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (Jica) some 18 years ago to consolidate all the known 30-35 routes into just eight major routes. (It was learned that only half of the 3,500-5,000 buses are needed to handle the passenger traffic on Edsa.) Then, add some of DOSTs road trains as soon as they become available commercially (this is the +1). The four- or five-coach road trains will ply only Edsa from the Mall of Asia Rotunda to the Monumento Rotunda. Due to the age of the Jica study, the eight routes and number of buses proposed may have to be tweaked. The older buses (perhaps those with lower capacity) not used on Edsa can be used as feeders at the end of the routes to complete the trips of our commuters with maximum convenience. The important thing is to get this modified BRT system going as soon as practicable. The Department of Transportation and Communications, Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board, and Metro Manila Development Authority can bid out the ownership of each route as a monopoly. To make it bankable, the franchise will have to be a minimum of 10 years or so. The chosen operator will have exclusive right to the route, end to endthat is, no other bus company can ply the route. Monopoly should mean no competition for passengers. At last, we may see passengers waiting for the bus, rather than the other way around! The monopoly holder should be deputized to ensure that no other public utility vehicle can ply the route particularly outside of Edsa. It will be a self-policing arrangement. (This is important because if others are allowed, it will again be a competition for passengers; the buses will again load and unload just anywhere. The monopoly holder will not be able to compete because other PUVs will then be able to load/unload anywhere.) Initially, these bidding parameters, among others, are suggested: The fare must be equal, no higher than the current and future MRT3 fares, the winner shall be the highest bidder for each route, and no one operator or consortium of operators can win more than two routes. The amount paid by the winning bidders will be used to partially cover the cost of additional pedestrian overpassesat least 15 to 20 moreon Edsa. Our hapless commuters are spending a considerable portion of their daily income on bus fares. Lower bus fares should help them save their money for other purposes. Lower fares are achievable because of the efficiency that can be achieved in organizing these nine routes into a monopoly: Tighter controls can mean higher load factors to approach full capacity on the average; operating with only half the number of the buses will mean half the operating cost and half the maintenance costs; more turnaround (up to double the current turnaround) means double the revenue. It is not impossible to wish for quadruple the revenue for the remaining buses. With no traffic (or at least much less traffic), at MRT3 fares, plus more bus stops and mostly one ride from point to point, all these measures should considerably cut down the debilitating queues at MRT stations. One possible glitch in this proposal (perhaps some more are still unknown) is that the nine routes will converge on the stretch from Guadalupe to East Avenue (called the Super Edsa Corridor), which can mean competition for short-trip passengers. Chaotic competition will probably not happen because all the vehicles will run on an exclusive lane next to the middle lane (at least while they are on Edsa). Passengers will not be able to board the vehicles unless in the station. They cannot go down from the vehicle anywhere as they have to cross the street using the passenger overpass. It looks to me a win-win-win solution: to the commuting public because of less traffic and savings in fares; to the operators for better profitability and to their employees for a reward of better pay; and to the government, in terms of not only partial savings from the congestion cost of P2.4 billion a day (as reckoned by Jica) but also the macroeconomic effect of putting more savings in the pockets of commuters.

2014-09-29,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesExpect to see thousands of Comets streaking across Metro Manila streets in the next five years. Roberto Obet Martin, president of transport group Pasang Masda, said his group was planning to replace 2,000 gas-guzzling public utility jeeps (PUJs) with City-Optimized Managed Electric Transport (Comet) e-jeepneys by next year. Launched on Saturday in Quezon City, the electronic jeeps first route was from SM North Edsa to the Light Rail Transit Line 2 Katipunan station. Last year, Pasang Masda signed a memorandum of agreement with Global Electric Transport (GET), the exclusive distributor of the e-jeeps, for the purchase of 10,000 Comet units. In a phone interview on Sunday, Martin said his group was hoping to replace at least 5,000 old PUJs by 2017. We are urging operators to junk and replace their old units to cut down on traffic and pollution, he added. Pasang Masda has 30,000 drivers and 15,000 transport operators in Metro Manila alone. It boasts 120,000 members nationwide. Martin said the drop and replace program would start in October, first targeting passenger jeeps plying the SM North-Katipunan route then eventually those plying the Lagro-Panay Avenue route, also in Quezon City. Comet jeeps are powered by lithium ion batteries that can be fully charged in five hours. It can travel up to 80 kilometers on a full charge based on a data sheet GET furnished the Inquirer. According to GET, it will cost less to power the Comet, as fully charging a unit will cost just P400 to P500 compared to P1,000 for diesel. The e-jeep has a speed cap of 60 kph. Its not common for jeepneys to go beyond 60 kph as they have to pick up passengers along the way. Besides, we need to be able to bring the passengers safely to their destinations. This way, we prevent accidents, Martin said. He pointed out that drivers would also no longer need to compete for passengers as the Comets would have designated stops with drivers enjoying a fixed salary with benefits for an eight-hour shift.",,"4:56 AM | Monday, September 29th, 2014",Pasang Masda Transport Group,yes,2014-09-29 00:00:00,alternative transportation ejeepney,,,,,,,,english,,http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/641294/comet-poised-to-take-king-of-the-road-title-from-pujs,,"quezon, metro manila, manila",text,,66.0,,854.0,,mavie,,,alternative transportation,7.0,Straight News,,,,,,inquirer,no,,,,,Comet poised to take King of the Road title from PUJs | Inquirer News,Neutral,,
2014-09-29,,,,"MANILA, Philippines - A transport official is proposing a new traffic scheme for Edsa, giving priority to public utility vehicles during the morning rush hours on weekdays. It will be a reverse of the current number-coding scheme, that, according to an official of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), will remove 80 percent of private vehicles from EDSA during the morning rush hours. We have to give priority to the public utility vehicles since private cars can find other roads apart from EDSA, LTFRB board member Ariel Inton said in an interview yesterday. Inton proposed that a private vehicle will not be allowed on EDSA from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. four days a week, but allowed to pass through other roads. All vehicles will be allowed along EDSA and other roads from 9 a.m. onwards. Under the current number coding scheme, a vehicle is not allowed to ply any road in Metro Manila one day a week from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. and from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. The last digit of the plate number determines the day a vehicle is prevented from moving around the metropolis. Under Inton's proposal, the last digit of the plate number determines when a private vehicle will be allowed on EDSA during the morning rush hours. The buses will have already transported their passengers by that time (9 a.m.) and some of (the buses) could just stay in their garage until the rush hours in the afternoon, Inton said, noting that his proposed scheme covers only the morning since people are no longer in a hurry in the afternoon. According to Inton, he intends to present this proposal to the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority. He said a number of bus operators claimed policies currently in place were detrimental to their situation, considering that their vehicles are the ones that transport more people. Inton said what he has in mind is for the community to cooperate and consider EDSA as a big restroom where everyone is accommodated. Let the early birds like students, teachers and employees use EDSA and Metro Rail Transit first, and followed by middle managers, and the last are those occupying top positions, who dont have to rush going to their offices. They are those who can perform their specific roles using cell phones and other high-tech gadgets, he added.

The message came from Senior Superintendent Wilben Mayor, PNP spokesperson, amid a public backlash over the special treatment given by traffic enforcers to FHM-Philippines pinup girl Alyzza Agustin for having a police connection. Agustin boasted on social media how she got away with a traffic violation by whipping out a signed card of Directorate for Plans chief Police Director Alexander Ignacio. Kahit anong violation, hulihin. It doesnt matter. All law enforcers should apprehend, Mayor told reporters. Now to avoid abuse, law enforcers on the ground shouldnt recognize anything. Especially those calling cards. Kapag nagpakita ng calling cards, hulihin niyo lalo! Mayor said. He also urged traffic enforcers on the ground to just follow the rules when in doubt if a violator presents a card of a police official. Mayor said the PNP is even encouraging all its officials to come up with their own business cards so people in their jurisdiction could easily contact them. Do not abuse calling cards. They are meant for communication purposes. Nothing else, he said. When asked if Ignacio would be held liable for giving out his card to the sexy model, Mayor plainly asked, who committed the violation? At the back of the card Agustin posted on Facebook was the signature of Ignacio and a message: PLS ASSIST MY EA, ALYZZA AGUSTIN. Mayor, who is on his second day as the new PNP spokesperson, asked the public to give Ignacio a chance to air his side. Assuming that Director Ignacio really signed the card, it is still the law enforcers discretion if he would accept it, he said. Ignacio is currently in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia for an Aseanapol-hosted event.

""The proposal is for vehicles to free EDSA during rush hours from 6 to 9 AM only, for the common good, and not for the banning of private vehicles at EDSA,"" Inton said. ""It is for the common good, because owners of private vehicles will also benefit if EDSA is unclogged from 6 to 9 AM only everyday.

2014-10-02,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesA shareholder in Metro Rail Transit (MRT) Holdings II on Wednesday blamed the governments failure to renew the original maintenance contractor for the current MRT 3 woes. MRT Holdings II executives and Transportation officials tangled at the resumption of the Senate hearing on MRT 3 train malfunctions, prompting a senator to suggest to get their act together. Everyone has a responsibilityIm not using the word blamewhy we are where we are right now. At the end of the day, I think the solution of MRT woes is for all of you guys to get your act together, Sen. Francis Escudero said. Instead of filing cases, government officials should sit down and talk, he said. Robert Sobrepea, chair of Fil-Estate (a major equity holder in MRT Holdings II that owns MRT Corp.), told senators that the termination of Sumitomo Corp. as original maintenance contractor in 2012 was a key factor in the MRT woes. Sumitomo, he said, designed, built and maintained the MRT 3 system under the principle of a single point of responsibility. By single point of responsibility, he meant that Sumitomo guaranteed 20 trains running at any given point in time. So when it terminated Sumitomo in October 2012, the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) effectively lost the most important feature of MRT 3: the single point of responsibility, said Sobrepea. The loss of the single point of responsibility has now led to the current state of finger pointing as to who is at fault for the sorry state of the MRT 3 system today, he said at the hearing by the subcommittee on transport. Transportation Secretary Joseph E.A. Abaya defended the termination of Sumitomo, saying the company raised its price from $1.4 million to $2 million a month, but refused to guarantee its work. As a secretary, I couldnt in conscience bear that we would be paying more, but the provider wouldnt warranty such, he said. After Sumitomo, PH Trams-CB&T Joint Venture and Global Inc. were contracted as maintenance providers. Global is the current maintenance provider. Senators sought the inquiry following the series of glitches that hit MRT trains, culminating in an Aug. 13 crash, on top of the long queues to the ticket booth. An MRT train hurtled past the railway at its Taft Avenue station in Pasay City, leaving 38 passengers hurt. The defective train was being pushed by another train when the coupler between them broke, sending it crashing through the metal stopper and concrete barrier of the last station. The train broke down at the Magallanes station. The 16.9-kilometer MRT 3 runs through 13 stations from the North Triangle in Quezon City to Edsa Taft in Pasay City. In the nearly five-hour long hearing, Sobrepea said Sumitomos contract expired in 2010 but DOTC extended this every six months until 2012. Then in October 2012, MRT 3 general manager Al Vitangcol informed MRT Corp. (MRTC) it wasnt renewing Sumitomo, and informed MRTC it had 12 days to contract a new maintenance provider, he said. Given the short period, the MRTC board, controlled by representatives of the Development Bank of the Philippines and Land Bank of the Philippines, agreed to contract an interim maintenance provider, the businessman said. This came with the understanding that the DOTC would present the terms of reference, and then bid out the maintenance of MRT 3 system, he said. DOTC appointed PH Trams. There was no bidding, he said. Abaya disputed Sobrepeas statement. It was MRTC who was extending. We merely concurred, he said, vowing to present documents to back this up. The government maintained that the procurement of maintenance provider has never left the MRTC.  And contrary to the businessmans claim, Abaya said the DOTC did not appoint PH Trams. He said PH Trams won in a simplified bidding where three companies took part. At that point in time, we had no time anymore. Otherwise, we would have stopped the trains, he said. I wear a public service hat. We feel that the service should continue for the people. Thus, the need to immediately procure Sobrepea insisted that it was the DOTC that made the recommendation, and the MRTC approved this. In 2010, nominees of government financial institutions (GFIs) led by Patricia Sto. Tomas proposed to the MRTC board that the procurement of maintenance provider be done by the DOTC. The MRT owners objected to this, but the board, now dominated by GFI nominees, acceded to this, he said.

2014-02-24,,,,"MANILA - You can strike all you want but truck ban violators will be apprehended. This is the message of Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada to truck drivers on strike after the city government imposed an extended daytime truck ban. Estrada and Vice-Mayor Isko Moreno said they will no longer talk to truckers' associations after negotiations were already made. Moreno said they have not deprived anyone of their jobs, they just want to change old habits and instill discipline. The city of Manila on Monday started the implementation of City Ordinance 8336, which bans the entry of trucks with a gross weight of 4,500 kilograms in the city from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m., except on Sundays and holidays. A revised version of the ordinance also gives truckers a window period of five hours, from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Estrada said truckers must follow the ordinance first. If there are indications that the daytime truck ban is not working or not effective, then that's the time when new negotiations for amendments may be discussed. A small group of truckers remain at their picket line just outside the gates of the Manila North Harbor. Estrada said the protests may continue but said he is ready to face any resistance. ""Mahirap na hinahamon ako,"" he said. Moreno also said expressed no love for the truck divers, saying they are ""indulto, perwisyo aksidente."" The mayor sees traffic in the port area to be decongested in six months, as the ports of Batangas and Subic are being tapped as alternate ports. Estrada said he now has to prioritize his constituents' safety welfare and comfort. Meantime, all roads to and from the Manila ports remain clear of trucks and container vans, hence, a traffic free Manila so far.

2014-10-06,,,," MANILA  Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) chairman Francis Tolentino said there are currently 109 public works projects ongoing in Metro Manila which contribute to heavy traffic. These include drainage, road repairs, and major infrastructure projects. Tolentino, however, said most of these will be finished by the first quarter of next year, ahead of the Asia Pacific Economic Council (APEC) summit in 2015. ''The challenge for motorists is how to navigate thorough fares. It's a big challenge for us because you're not in a normal street scenario, but these obstructions are not permanent,'' he told ANC's Headstart. Tolentino also appealed to the public to give the 4-day work week for government employees a chance to ease traffic congestion. ''Give it a try, siguro mga 6 months.

2014-10-12,,,,"With the price of diesel below P40 per liter, a transport group has called for a fare adjustment for passenger jeepneys that will eventually lower the minimum fare to P8. ""Nananawagan ako sa mga kaibigan na magsama-sama na tayo para mabigyan natin ng pamaskong handog ang ating mga pasahero,"" Pasang Masda national president Obet Martin said in a report on GMA News TV's ""Balitanghali"" on Sunday. However, this suggestion was rejected by other jeepney transport groups. Jeepney drivers and operators have yet to recover from the oil price increase this year, said Liga ng Transportasyon at mga Operator sa Pilipinas (LTOP) president Lando Marquez. ""Kawawa na naman itong mga tsuper na hindi nakaka-boundary dahil sa problema sa traffic, nagkakabuhul-buhol, baha kapag umuulan,"" he said. ""Kung meron man 'yong nagpapapogi, siguro kailangan magkaintidihan muna, mag-unawaan muna para mapag-usapan,"" he added. Other transport groups that rejected the call to make price adjustment were Alliance of Concerned Transport Organizations (ACTO) and the Federation of Jeepney Operators and Drivers Association of the Philippines (FEJODAP). The price of diesel is currently at around P38 per liter following A provisional fare increase of P8.5 minimum fare was enacted last June. In separate interviews, two jeepney drivers concurred with the transport groups against the fare cut. ""Sa totoo lang, hindi naman talaga sapat dahil sa sunod-sunod na pagtaas ng [gasolina] minsan lang kami makapagtaas ng pamasahe,"" one driver said. ""Kapag tumaas ang diesel, sana wag kaming pahirapan kapag kami ang humirit naman ng pasahe,"" said the other. Instead of filing a petition every time the drivers wish to increase the minimum fare, Martin suggested that an agreement between transport groups and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) be forged. Under the proposed agreement, the prices of diesel should automatically increase or cut the fare. For instance, the minimum fare should be maintained at P8 if the price of diesel is below P40 per liter; if the diesel prices climb to P40/L to P43/L, the minimum fare should be at P8.50; if the gasoline prices are between P44/L to P46/L, then the fare should be at P9; and if diesel prices breach P47/L, then the minimum fare should be at P10.

2014-10-15,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesClosed off for 10 months, the Lacson Underpass in Quiapo, Manila, reopened on Tuesday after an extensive renovation and rebranding that gave the half-century-old pedestrian tunnel the look and feel of a mall. Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada welcomed the public back to what is now called Victory Lacson Underpass, which was closed for upgrades in January. To those who have used the underpass before, you will be surprised because of the huge changes weve made. The dirty and grimy pathways are now clean, the crime-prone areas are now safe, and the dark areas are now bright, Estrada said. The underpass was air-conditioned from the day it was opened in the 1960s, reflecting the visionary leadership of the citys leaders back then, he added. However, like many other landmarks in Manila, it has also seemingly fallen into neglect. Previous administrations would tidy it up but it would again fall into disrepair. The first underground crossing in the country was named in honor of then Mayor Arsenio Lacson, whose administration initiated the project. Lacson, however, did not live to see it finished; his successor, Antonio Villegas, oversaw its completion. The newly renovated underpass features glass doors at the six entrances accessible from Quezon Boulevard, Hidalgo Street, Arlegui Street and the Quiapo Church. Pedestrians can enjoy a cooler walk, thanks to the new air-conditioning system, and have more excuses to slow down as they cross, starting with the inviting and brightly lit shops. Security guards and policemen are on constant patrol. Small-time vendors are also given their orderly places. The biggest changes can be found in the toilets which are now also air-conditioned and come with soft lighting, new fixtures like motion-sensing faucets and an elegant overall finish from the tiled floor up. The renovations allotted space for 26 regular stalls, 105 micro-retail stalls or thrift shops, 36 small kiosks, 19 food carts and four automated teller machines. According to Vice Mayor Francisco Isko Moreno Domagoso, the city government did not spend a single centavo for the makeover and will also not foot the bill for maintenance. White Scope Property Management Inc., the firm behind the Victory Mall chain in Caloocan, Pasay, and Antipolo cities, among others, won the public bidding for the renovation contract earlier this year and earned the right to operate the underpass for 25 years under a joint venture agreement with City Hall. The company will also manage the commercial stalls and has been made part of the rebranding, hence the new name Victory Lacson. The rent for kiosks and spaces for food carts is pegged at P35,000 per month; regular stalls are worth P5,000, while micro-retail stores (similar to those erected by the city government in Divisoria) cost lower to rent.

2014-10-15,,,,"I have very bad news for Metro Manilans: The horrendous traffic jams and floods will be with us until next year. This comes straight from Francis Tolentino, chair of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority, although he did not say it exactly that way. What he told the Kapihan sa Manila at the Diamond Hotel last Monday (the other guest was former congressman Danilo Suarez) was that the traffic jams are brought about by a combination of factors: diggings on the streets by the Department of Public Works and Highways and by the water concessionaires, the lack of an efficient transport system, too many vehicles on too few streets, and the lack of coordination among the agencies involved in transportation. Those too-frequent road reblocking projects by contractors hired by the DPWH naturally slow down traffic. The diggings by water concessionaires Maynilad and Manila Water are another culprit. Ironically, the flood-control projects of DPWH often worsen the floods. One example: The construction of the Blumentritt Interceptor that would channel flood waters to Manila Bay is exacerbating the flooding in Manilas downtown area. The Interceptor is unfinished until now and so the floodwaters cannot flow out to Manila Bay. Hopefully, it will be completed by next year. The lack of an efficient transport system is the biggest cause of the traffic jams. The elevated rail lines should have been efficient and fast, but there are not enough trains to accommodate all the commuters needing a ride. The wait in the long lines just to go up to the MRT3 stations is much longer than the trip itself. The government has ordered more trains from China but the prototype wont be coming until the first quarter of 2015. The prototype will be tried on the existing rails, and only after all kinks are ironed out will the construction of the trains begin. The coaches will be delivered here in batches and it will take many months before all 48 coaches are delivered. Again, hopefully, they will all be here and running before the end of 2015. The problem with the buses is the opposite: There are just too many of them. So they clog the streets, especially Edsa, where they crawl like snails wasting precious fuel and polluting the air but do not carry enough passengers. The buses crawling bumper to bumper on Edsa are half-empty even during rush hours. Commuters do not want to ride buses because these are too slow, and spending much time dawdling at stations to wait for passengers. MMDA Chair Tolentino is at a loss on how the buses manage to stay on considering that they dont have enough passengers. I dont know how they survive, he told the journalists present at the Kapihan. My theory is that the bus companies are overcharging commuters. Those few passengers are paying for all the empty seats. The inefficiency of the mass transport system, in turn, forces commuters to buy their own vehicles, but they only add to the traffic congestion. Every year, car assemblers pour out onto the streets 300,000 new cars. That number does not include the vehicles smuggled into the country and the jeepneys and buses assembled from recycled parts. Where are you going to put all of them when very few streets are being built? Tolentino said. Ironically, a government agency, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board, is to blame for the oversupply of buses on Edsa. It has issued too many franchises to bus companies. Doesnt it know the holding capacity of Edsa? Then there are the colorum buses. The LTFRB cannotor does not want toprevent them from operating so they dont add to the traffic jams on Edsa. Guess why? To make matters worse, complained Tolentino, the LTFRB lifted the ban on cargo trucks earlier banned by the MMDA from Metro streets. Cant the Department of Transportation and Communications coordinate all the transport agencies so they dont work at cross purposes? It cannot even fix the problems of MRT3 and the long-delayed issuance of license plates by the Land Transportation Office. With more and more vehicles being poured out onto the streets and almost none being phased out, traffic congestion has gotten worse through the years. Tolentino said he had added to the public transport system by resuming the ferry operation on the Pasig River. Theres no traffic, the ferry is fast and cheap but sadly, few commuters use it. I already lowered the fare to attract more passengers, still the passengers have not increased dramatically, Tolentino said. Could it be peoples natural fear of the water, or the stench from the Pasig? How about a subway? Yes, that would be a great help, Tolentino said. Ex-Congressman Suarez said a subway system was planned during President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyos administration but that her term ended before it could be implemented. Tolentino and Suarez agreed that Metro Manila should be decongested by making outlying areas its bedroom and by locating industries to the provinces so the rural residents dont have to flock to the metropolis to get jobs.",Neal H.

2014-10-20,,,,"The Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) wants to move forward with its Integrated Transport System public private partnerships deals, which have been delayed partly due to questions on their impact on regulations to govern public vehicles that will use them. In line with this, Transportation Secretary Joseph Abaya said his department was holding talks with the Department of Finance, which was concerned about whether DOTC should guarantee the franchise modifications of these operators. The ITS system was designed to create intermodal hubs where provincial buses would disembark passengers to transfer to other in-city modes of transport such as rail lines, city buses and UV Express vans. The move was also aimed at easing congestion in Metro Manila. To do this, the franchise should be modified so these public vehicle operators would use the ITS projects, Abaya said. From my end, it should [be modified]. If not, it will affect its viability, Abaya said. I think LTFRB [Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board] has the power to do that. And we should commit to that, otherwise, who will bid? Abaya said. The DOTC is currently seeking bidders for two ITS projects, one is the P2.5-billion ITS Southwest located near Manila-Cavite Expressway and the P4-billion ITS-South, near the Food Terminal Inc. compound in Taguig. A third ITS project is being planned for the northern part of Metro Manila but the DOTC has yet to decide on the location. The DOTC extended the qualification deadline for the ITS-South project to Nov. 4, a bid bulletin showed on Oct. 17. For the ITS-Southwest deal, the transport department is hoping to finish the concession agreement this month, which would place the bid submission date around November this year, PPP Center executive director Cosette Canilao said earlier. Among the prospective bidders for the ITS-Southwest deal are Ayala Corp., San Miguel Corp., Metro Pacific Investments Corp. and Robinsons Land.

2014-10-22,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesA senior opposition lawmaker criticized the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) for submitting a substantial errata on their budget supposedly for the upgrade and rehabilitation of the Metro Rail Transit (MRT) line 3. During Wednesdays House of Representatives transportation committee inquiry on the equity buyout on MRT, Bayan Muna Representative Neri Colmenares said the errata would amend the budget bill even if it had already been approved by the plenary on second reading. MRT 3 Director for Operations Renato San Jose said they sent a P1.8-billion errata on their P804-million budget. Colmenares noted that the erratum is larger than the proposed budget. How can therebe an error so large? It seems to show you dont know what you need, Colmenares said. said they sent an errata because there is no supplemental budget that would be submitted to the House. Colmenares said the DOTC seemed unprepared in crafting the budget for the MRTs upgrade and rehabilitation. He added that an errata only pertains to typographical errors and not on the budgetary amount. That errata will be subject to a serious constitutional challenge You cannot amend the law on a mere errata on third reading, Colmenares said. Government is preparing its buyout of the private operator of the MRT 3 in a bid to end paying billions of rental fees as well as terminate the ongoing arbitration case between government and the MRT Corporation. The buyout is being mulled amid constant breakdowns plaguing MRT commuters that culminated in a derailment that hurt 38 passengers. On August 13, an MRT train hurtled past the railway at its Taft Avenue station in Pasay City. The defective train was being pushed by another train when the coupler between them broke, sending it crashing through the metal stopper and concrete barrier of the last station.

2014-10-23,,,"Public officials, Government agencies","For much of the last month, my Facebook friends in Manila have been posting comments lamenting their utter frustration and helplessnessat being condemned to spending a great portion of what is left of their productive lives stuck in traffic with no hope in sight. They agree with Dan Browns description of Manila in his book, , as the gates of hell because of its apocalyptic features including six-hour traffic jams (and) suffocating pollution. It may feel like six hours to those stuck in gridlock hell. These days travel time in the streets of Metro Manila can be three times longer than usual, and this is during sunny days. With a heavy downpour and flash floods, the nations premier region becomes paralyzed was how one Manila daily described it. The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) estimates that Metro Manilas traffic jams are costing the Philippine economy P2.4 billion pesos ($57 million) a day in potential income, a figure that JICA warns couldballoon to P6 billion ($142 M) a day by 2030. The JICA report also pointed out that traffic congestion leads to increased fuel consumption and automobile emissions as vehicles are forced to operate less efficiently. More vehicles on the road means increased greenhouse gas emissions which lead to increased health costs. Greenhouse gas emissions, JICA warned, are expected to increase to 5.72 million tons a year in 2030, compared to 4.7 million tons a year in 2012. The increase ingreenhouse gas emissionsaffect the frequency and ferocity of the natural calamities that regularly strike the Philippines. Rappler writer Katerina Francisco explains that JICAs P2.4 billion a day figure includes lost work hours, lost business opportunities due to delays and missed deadlines and wasted fuel. She observes that these annual losses (P576 billion a year) are greater than the P400 billion infrastructure budget for 2014. When an alternative 10 hour day/4 day work week schedule was proposed as a way to ameliorate traffic gridlock, Sen. J.V. Ejercito expressed his opposition to the idea because of what he said was its effect on family life. According to Neal Cruz (Will the 4 day work week work?), Sen. Ejercito said, the employee who has to hurry home to cook for the family would get there very late and the children would be starving by the time dinner is served. Eating a late dinner means staying up late and therefore waking up late the next morning and arriving late in schools and offices. And most of the children and adults would be too sleepy to learn and work efficiently. But that is precisely what is happening now with a five-day work week because commuters who dont have chauffeurs to drive them around like Sen. Ejercito spend up to three hours commuting to and from work. The four-day a week plan at least offers hope of spending one less day in gridlock hell, which is precious time parents can spend with their children. Sen. Ejercito and other government officials should follow the lead of Sen. Grace Poe and actually spend a day riding public transportation to work to appreciate the hell that their constituents are going through every day. They may then consider other alternatives to easing traffic congestion like staggering the work hours of employees so that some of them can report for work at 10 am, 11 am or 12 noon and work until 6 pm, 7 pm or 8 pm. With less traffic, they may likely arrive home at the same time that they otherwise would when their work hours end at 5 pm. What has exacerbated Manilas traffic mess is the decision of the Department of Public Works to embark this year on the simultaneous construction of 15 major road projects which are all expected to be completed by 2016. This has transformed an already congested metropolis into a traffic nightmare. Government representatives explain that the public works projects are intended to solve traffic congestion and help the Philippines achieve inclusive growth. But UP Prof. Jose Regin Regidor questioned just exactly how inclusive the road projects can be when they are focused only on commuters who use cars and buses. Prof. Regidor said the government should spend more on mass transit systems to decongest a bursting mega city. An example of what could be done to improve public transportation is what Bangkok recently entered into with a Japanese consortium to build an urban transit system there for $405 million. As the INQUIRER.net reported on November 4, 2013, under the deal, ordered by Bangkok Metro Public Co., the consortium will construct a new 23-kilometer (14-mile) rail line in the Thai capital, the daily said, adding the rail operation is set to start in 2016. The Japanese group will supply 63 train cars and build the power grid, signals and rail yards as well as 16 stations for the project. It will also provide maintenance services under a 10-year contract and about 20 technicians with operational expertise will be stationed in Bangkok, the report said. Unlike Bangkok, Metro Manila already has a rapid transit rail system in place called the Metro Rail Transit or MRT-3 which consists of a single line that runs in the general direction along the north and south lanes of Edsa Avenue serving close to 560,000 passengers a day. It was constructed by a consortium of private companies led by Robert John Sobrepena of the Fil-Estate Management, Inc. under a Build-Operate-Transfer arrangement, which placed all the risks on the private companies to build the MRT system. The total cost for the project was $675.5 Million. The MRT-3 was inaugurated in 1999 and operated by Metro Rail Transit Corporation (MRTC), the private consortium. In 2010, the state-owned Land Bank of the Philippines and Development Bank of the Philippines purchase a majority interest in the MRTC and began working at the direction of the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) headed by Joseph Emilio Abaya, the former three-term congressman from Cavite who previously chaired the House Appropriations Committee. The DOTC has asked the Philippine Congress to allocate P54 Billion pesos ($1.285 Billion) in the next budget for the DOTC to purchase the state-owned bonds of the MRTC so that it can bid out the contract for a new maintenance provider. This amount isa total waste of government resources. It is twice what Bangkok is paying a Japanese consortium to construct a 23- kilometer rail line with 63 cars and a 10 year maintenance contract. Government funds should be better used to improve, expand and extend mass transit. If this is the priority of the DOTC, then it reflects a callous disregard of the needs the 12 million people stuck in gridlock hell.",Rodel Rodis,"6:50 AM | Thursday, October 23rd, 2014",Japan International Cooperation Agency JICA,yes,2014-10-23 00:00:00,"formulation of legislationlocal ordinances,road infrastructure repair,maintenance,reports on traffic congestion",,,,,,,,english,,http://globalnation.inquirer.net/113269/manilas-traffic-jams-cost-57-million-a-day/,,"cavite, metro manila, manila",text,,383.0,,2188.0,,candice,,,"policy and legislation, vehicle safety and maintenance, road infrastructure, traffic congestion",5.5,Commentary or Editorial,,,,,"improvement of traffic enforcement, improvement of road infrastructure, improvement of mass public transport infrastructure, suggestion for 4day work week",inquirer,no,yes,national,,,Manilas traffic jams cost $57 million a day | Inquirer Global Nation,Pessimistic,,
2014-10-23,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesStarting Tuesday, October 28, provincial buses will be allowed to use all tunnels on Epifanio delos Santos Avenue (Edsa)except on the Ayala section of the highway. Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) chairman Francis Tolentino signed on Thursday a memorandum circular allowing 3,300 provincial buses to pass through both the northbound and southbound lanes of three Edsa underpasses. From October 28 until January 4, 2015, provincial buses will be allowed to use the Shaw Boulevard, P. Tuazon and Aurora tunnels. Tolentino said the scheme was meant to ease traffic congestion in preparation for All Souls Day, semestral breaks and the holidays. These buses, however, will only be allowed to use the rightmost lane of each tunnel. Tolentino also reiterated that the scheme would only be effective from Monday to Saturday. Under the MMDA Transport and Traffic Management MC No. 3, an odd-even scheme will be applied in the usage of Edsa underpasses. Provincial buses with plate numbers ending in1,3,5,7 and 9 may use the tunnels every Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday only. For buses with plate numbers ending in 2,4,6,8, and 0, they will only be allowed every Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Violators would be fined P500. In anticipation of traffic accidents, Tolentino said that the MMDA would put tow trucks on standby. Tolentino said the MMDA may consider extending the scheme until after January 4.

2014-10-23,,,,"  In a statement posted on Twitter, Tolentino said ride-sharing services actually promote the welfare of commuters.  Uber or hybrid carpooling is a well-meaning technology-driven effort intended for public safety and convenience that's why people are patronizing it. We cannot curtail their mobility rights, Tolentino said.  Tolentino then compared ride-sharing services to private cars for rent that offer different yet similar services.  This is similar to private bridal cars and private ambulances for rent which is a private transaction between the rider and the owner of the vehicle, Tolentino said.  Tolentino added that the ride-sharing services should be given a chance as commuters stood to gain from this system.  Perhaps there is another way of looking at this system, as no irregularity under the Public Service Law, as amended, is being committed here, and has proven to be beneficial to commuters, said Tolentino, a lawyer.  Tolentino's statement came after the LTFRB announced that it was going after ride-sharing services such as Uber with fines ranging from P120,000 to P200,000 depending on the vehicle type.  According to the LTFRB, they are apprehending ride-sharing services not because of their service but due to the fact that they do not operate under franchises the way taxi cabs and other public utility vehicles do.  The first apprehension was made on Wednesday after a Fortuner running an Uber service was apprehended in the Metrowalk area in Pasig City. The fine was pegged at P200,000.  Uber is a service that allows commuters to hail a vehicle for their use through their smartphone.

Barrion said the complainant booked another trip from Timog Avenue to East Avenue in Quezon City but the driver, after receiving a call, immediately told the passengers that the booking was canceled. The Uber account of the complainant was later blocked. Ginez clarified, however, that the subject of the operation was the private vehicle.

2014-10-24,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesIn a case where government regulators appear to be playing catch-up with technology, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) apprehended a driver of a private vehicle whose services were tapped by a paying rider through a mobile app. The LTFRB acted on a complaint from the Philippine National Taxi Operators Association (PNTOA) against Uber, a technology start-up that connects passengers with private drivers for hire through a mobile app of the same name. According to PNTOA, the vehicles hired through Uber should be apprehended for being colorum or for operating like taxicabs without the proper franchise. In a sting operation arranged by the LTFRB on Wednesday, a poseur customer booked a ride using Uber from Metrowalk in Pasig City to Quezon Memorial Circle in Quezon City, with the fare set at P350, according to Dennis Barrion, chief of staff of LTFRB Executive Director Roberto Cabrera. Upon reaching the destination, the driver of the black Toyota Fortuner (WII 360) was approached by teams from the LTFRB and the Land Transportation Office (LTO) to confiscate his license and have the vehicle impounded for a franchise violation, Barrion said. The offense carries a P200,000 fine under the LTFRB-LTO Joint Administrative Order 2014-01, a directive issued in June that sharply raised the penalties for erring drivers and operators. Barrion said the same poseur customer booked another trip that day, this time from Timog Avenue to East Avenue in Quezon City. However, the assigned driver later told the would-be client that the booking had been canceled. The customer later discovered that his Uber account had already been blocked. In an interview Thursday, PNTOA president Bong Suntay, who is also a Quezon City councilor, said were complaining because Uber and the vehicles they are using are basically colorum vehicles. [Uber] will say they are just a technology [provider], a marketplace, but the vehicles they are using cannot legally charge the passengers, Suntay said. Its unfair to legitimate public utility vehicles because we pay taxes, we pay regulatory fees and supervision fees. And yet they (Uber network of vehicles) are competing with us when theyre not licensed to do it, he added. They also dont have liabilities if something happens to the passengers. Uber on Wednesday issued a statement addressed to its partner drivers and operators, calling the LTFRB operation unfair. As we have always assured youand all our partners in the 220+ cities we operate in globallywe will support you and seek swift resolution to this incident. Ever since Uber was launched in Manila almost a year ago to introduce the safest and most reliable way to get around the Metro, Filipino riders have unanimously rallied behind you by taking more and more trips with you every day. Uber Manila, whose parent company is based in San Francisco, also encouraged its partners to contact the company when faced with a similar situation. In an interview, LTFRB Chair Winston Ginez clarified that Wednesdays sting operation targeted and penalized only the driver of the private vehiclenot Uber itself. We havent looked into Ubers liability insofar as the LTFRB is concerned, he said. But Ginez said Uber may be acting as a conduit that facilitates private vehicles to commit a violation of the Public Service Law. [Uber] doesnt need to secure a franchise because its not a transport company. They dont carry passengers, Ginez said. But through its application, private unlicensed vehicles are able to engage in public land transportation without securing a franchise from the LTFRB. But another government agency concerned with mass transport asked the LTFRB to go easy on Uber. In a statement on Thursday, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) urged the board to find ways to reasonably assist transport services like Uber, instead of cracking down on their operations, in view of the inadequate public transport systems in the capital. The muscle of the law and the procedural and technical arms of government agencies alone cannot solve the lack of alternative means of transportation. They can only increase apprehension records. Uber or hybrid carpooling is a well-meaning technology-driven effort intended for public safety and convenience. Thats why people are patronizing it, said MMDA Chair Francis Tolentino. The MMDA chief also pointed out that the government could not curtail the mobility rights of the people. This (service) is similar to private bridal cars and private ambulances for rent which is a private transaction between the rider and the owner of the vehicle. Inasmuch as the government would not allow the taxicab industry to fail, it should not also curtail the options (presented by Uber), the convenience, comfort and riding safety, he said, noting that the company also offers top-of-the-line sport utility vehicles and limousines. For Tolentino, there is still another way of looking at this system since it does not clash with the Public Service Law and has proven to be beneficial to commuters.

Provincial buses with plate numbers ending in 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 may use the tunnels from Monday to Wednesday.  Those whose plate numbers end in 2, 4, 6, 8, and 0 may use the tunnels from Thursday to Saturday. The tunnels are off-limits to provincial buses on Sundays.  Under the scheme of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority, provincial buses may pass through three of four tunnels along Epifanio delos Santos Avenue (EDSA).  But while the scheme appears good on paper, some motorists still concerned about some of its aspects, GMA News' Steve Dailisan reported on ""24 Oras.""  The three tunnels include Shaw Boulevard, P. Tuazon and Aurora. Only the EDSA-Ayala tunnel is still off-limits.  ""Ang purpose natin dito makatulong sa holiday season kasama itong Undas at sem break,"" MMDA chairman Francis Tolentino said.  ""Lalo na pag Undas, maraming pasahero, hindi na makikipagagawan ang mga provincial buses sa service road,"" said Provincial Bus Operators Association of the Philippines spokesman Alex Yague.  Previously, buses and heavy equipment were not allowed to pass through the tunnels since it would take responders a long time to get to them in case of an emergency.  On the other hand, some motorists are not fully on board with the idea, as this could mean heavy traffic at tunnels especially during rush hour.  ""Usually ang mga bus na yan yan ang tumitigil sa gilid-gilid. And kung dadaan sila sa tunnel yan lang dinadaanan namin nang mabilis-bilis,"" said a motorist.  Meanwhile, Tolentino urged bus operators and motorists to make sure their vehicles are roadworthy.

2014-10-25,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesThe recent apprehension of a private driver hired through the mobile app Uber in Quezon City signaled the latest battle to erupt between the company behind the technology and government-regulated taxicab associations around the world. But the regional head of Uber Technologies, reacting to the actions taken by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), declared that it was determined to challenge outdated regulations and innovate a sector characterized by stagnation. We are disappointed that the government has taken action against a technology service that is better for riders, drivers and the community, Mike Brown, the start-ups general manager for Southeast Asia and Australia, said in a statement Friday. Brown said Uber is operating in 222 cities in 45 countries and in many of those cities, we are challenging outdated (premobile era) regulations that are unable to keep up with technological advancement. Uber is committed to put the interest of consumers and their communities as priority by bringing something fresh and new to a sector that is characterized by stagnation, Brown added. Safe, reliable and convenient transportation optionssomething that Filipinos have been demanding for a long time now. The LTFRB on Thursday said it conducted an entrapment operation the day before in which an Uber-affiliated driver was slapped a P200,000 fine, his license confiscated and his vehicle impounded. The move was spurred by a complaint from the Philippine National Taxi Operators Association, which said Uber vehicles should be considered colorum for operating like taxicabs without the proper franchise. In a radio interview Friday, LTFRB Chair Winston Ginez said the drive against unauthorized Uber vehicles would continue even as he called on the tech company to use duly licensed vehicles instead. The government would not have any way of protecting the individuals who use private vehicles because those are not covered by the LTFRB, Ginez said. But he said the LTFRB was open to a dialogue with Uber on how its operation could continue without violating the Public Service Law. Were not against new technology. There are applications like GrabTaxi and EasyTaxi which use taxis with franchise, Ginez told Radyo Inquirer.

2014-10-26,,,"Public officials, Government agencies","Frequent traffic gridlock has traumatized residents of Metro Manila. Dinner guests at a Makati hotel one rain-drenched evening a couple of weeks ago compared notes, with one making a three-hour trip from Paraaque City and another traveling four hours from Balara, Quezon City. Then on the way home, close to midnight, this motorist is shamed by commuters queued up almost a kilometer long, three- or four-person deep, some under the rain, waiting for their ride home. In just six to seven hours, they will have to start their day again with long queues going to work and long queues going home. It is the responsibility of the government to provide commuters a decent, dignified and affordable means of transport. This is the least this government can do for these commuters are President Aquinos bosses. The President should immediately form a special technical working group (TWG) composed of the heads of the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC), Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) and Metro Manila Development Authority to finally do a comprehensive mass transit system capable of handling the volume of commuters not only today but a hundred years forward. The TWG shall have one single goal: Set the solution in place now, signed and sealed tight, virtually irreversible. With Mr. Aquino and the public works secretary enjoying the peoples high confidence, the public will accept any decision by this administration. This is our golden opportunity. Lets not squander it. A major project like this will attract the corrupt in the government, much as what happened to the North Rail and the nuclear power plant under past administrations. Conversely, this game-changing infrastructure can become a good governance success story. The improvement in the lives of millions of Metro Manila residents, particularly the commuters, and the increase in investors confidence can be Mr. Aquinos legacy. To plan long term, we need metrics to guide us: What is the ideal number of mass transport kilometers? As an order-of-magnitude indicator, one possible parameter is population per commuter rail kilometer (ppcrk) of the well-managed megacities in terms of traffic flows. Very roughly, the average among the top cities is about 30,000 ppcrk. With Metro Manilas 15 million inhabitants, we should have around 500 km of commuter rail in the metropolis. Our existing 51 km (LRT 1, LRT 2 and MRT 3) plus Philippine National Railways (PNR) commuter run of about 29 km (Tutuban to Alabang) plus their planned extension and the almost done MRT 7 total 118 km. We will still need 382 km to approach the norm. The present 51 km of elevated light rails have all but destroyed the once beautiful and historic Avenida Rizal, Taft Avenue, Aurora Boulevard and even Edsa. To add 382 km or 7.5 times more of elevated-type railways could further uglify this former Paris of the East. Thus, we are advocating the installation of a heavy-rail mass transport subway network. It will be aesthetically pleasing. It can be set up with least disturbance to the current traffic. Its high capacity and less right-of-way issues make it cost-competitiveeven less expensive on a passenger per kilometer basis than the elevated type. Metro Manila is fortunate to have a subsoil known as Guadalupe Tuff, a type of adobe ideal for tunneling. Finally, subway is the favored solution adopted by many Asian megacities. Competent international organizations have estimated the congestion cost at up to P2.4 billion a day, roughly $20 billion a year using such factors as wasted fuel and manpower hours, health issues and foregone business opportunities. A 2011 subway study estimated its cost at $100 million a kilometer; the tunnel cost at 40 percent or $40 million a kilometer; the 382 km of tube would cost around $15.2 billion. Even if we assume only 25 percent or $5 billion of the $20-billion cost per year can be saved by the subway system, it will take only three years to recoup the $15.2-billion cost. If the 382 km of rail will bring us first-class city status in traffic, the recovery could be just 1.3 years. I am segregating the cost of the tube because I am recommending that it be owned by the government as a public works asset. With a century or more life-span, it will exist in good working condition way beyond any concession period given to public-private partnership participants or way beyond the lives of the present citizens and their children (Londons 150-year-old subway and New Yorks 125-year-old system are still in good use). Future citizens should carry some of the burden of this very long-term asset. Also, being government-owned the winning international tube contractor can perhaps avail itself of official development assistance (ODA) from its home country. With concessional interest rate, grace period (sometimes 20 years) and payment plan of ODAs, we would have recouped the investment before the first amortization. If the 382 km of new rail is ambitious, as other means of mitigating traffic congestion can also be implemented (like the modified BRT along Edsa I proposed earlier), the government may opt to discontinue after the first 150 km or the second, maybe 20 years down the road. Plans can be scaled down accordingly to realities on the ground. Our country has been criticized time and again for not spending enough for infrastructure. This could be part of the answer. Now, why a special TWG? So it can laser focus on this extremely important project for the management of the bidding process. It can do the following: Hire the best transport and rail planners:  Determine commuter movements in 10 to 20 years;  Lay out the definite alignment of the first 150 km, approximate the next 150 km and guess the last 82 km; the first 150 km to be further subdivided into workable segments of 30 to 40 km each;  Locate optimal sites for subway stations and determine their basic requirements at least for the first 150 km; Hire top-level consultants to prepare detailed engineering designs for the initial 150 km of tubes and various stations, optimal performance standards, environmental impact, economic and social benefits, value for money, and geotechnical and other technical analyses; Bid out the construction of the tube under the supervision of the DPWH (based on the results of the first two bullet points), inviting the worlds best tunnel borers who can be supported by their countrys ODA programs, and find ways to tunnel simultaneously from two or more points to achieve quicker relief; Bid out, with the help of transaction advisers, to rail companies and property developers the development of the stations and the use of properties adjacent to the alignment for ingress and egress; develop opportunities for nonrail revenues, and the operations and maintenance of the rail system. The government will be the biggest beneficiary of smooth traffic flow: happier people with more productive hours, leisure time, quality time with family and fewer health issues. As a subway system, it would mean higher real estate values in its alignmentmeaning higher real estate taxes and more people visiting the places and making local businesses active. The second biggest beneficiary will be the commuters. With no tube cost, the fare will become more reasonable. Less fare cost, less pressure for salary increases, more money to spend. The rail company with no tube cost will need less borrowing that it can carry on its own balance sheet, needing no government support for its loans. Therefore, the government will have no right to monkey around with the fare, which usually leads to the dreaded government subsidy in the end. With the government owning all the tubes, the tubes in all sectors of the subway system will be of one design and all subway sectors will seamlessly merge with one another unlike the LRT 1/MRT 3s planned convergence. To illustrate how a subway system might look like, here are some results of a decade-long study started by a renowned international consultancy group and continued by its successor local company, Applied Planning & Infrastructure Inc., which generously allowed me to use some of their findings. The result is a business case for the first 33 km of a 125-km system to evolve within the next two decades or, hopefully, shorter. Several traffic studies show that the high priority is a north-south orientation along some of the highest population density areas of the old part of Manila, Quezon City, Taguig City and San Juan City to connect to where people workthe central business districts of Makati City and the new Global City. This alignment will require a massive underground rail backbone capable of transporting 80,000 people/hour/direction equivalent to 1,300 buses per hour. It will carry more than double the current MRT 3 load. Recent reports show that the DOTC favors an east-west orientation. While this alignment may eventually be necessary, it will probably be much later on, maybe past 2030. Even LRT 2, which has an east-west orientation, has not even reached its design capacity while the north-south MRT 3 and LRT 1 are already bloated. Even Japan International Cooperation Agencys dream plan advocates a subway underneath Edsa, which has a north-south orientation. But Edsa is already saddled by MRT 3 and thousands of buses and even more cars and trucks. Concentrating more transport on Edsa may not be the best solution. This is why our north-south suggestion is located more in the center of the megalopolis where the bulk of high-density population areas is concentrated. It will also relieve MRT 3 of much of its overload. About 85 percent of ridership is driven by home-to-workplace demand. If a station can be installed within 1-km radius from their homes and offices, people will be attracted to use this subway. Multimodal interchanges would connect the system to North Luzon Expressway (NLEx) and PNR in the North and Global City, Food Terminal Inc. (FTI) and South Luzon Expressway (SLEx) in the South, decongesting the Edsa/MRT 3 corridor. Here is how the alignment might look like: It will start from FTI where the big, largely unused property of PNR is located. This would be ideal for a depot-cum-bus stops, where provincial buses and other feeder buses and jeepneys can have their depots. It has enough area for huge parking spaces for the park-and-ride commuters. From FTI, it will have stops at C5/Taguig; Global City; Edsa-Ayala; Ayala/Paseo; Buendia/Ayala; old Sta. Ana; Kalentong/Shaw; Sta. Mesa (to meet LRT 2); Araneta/Espaa Extension; Araneta/Quezon Avenue; Quezon Avenue/West Avenue; North Avenue/Edsa area (to meet MRT 3 and the future MRT 7). Then, it will further extend to Congressional Road and NLEx, and to SLEx, Ninoy Aquino International Airport and Mall of Asia. Then it will eventually connect Quezon Avenue to Del Monte, Mayon Street in La Loma then Rizal Avenue to connect to LRT 1 to the proposed North Rail exchange then to MacArthur Highway to the north depot. (See metro red, brown, express blue and green lines on this page.) The red line alignment serves as a parallel route from Ayala/Edsa to Edsa/North Avenue, unburdening some loads off MRT 3. It will also relieve some pressure from LRT 1 and LRT 2. How will a typical station entrance look like? (See photo.) Notice that all you see are the entrance to and exit from the subway station. The station will, of course, take into consideration the history of floods in each area, say the 100-year highest flood level adjusted to the latest climate changes. Forward 50- to 100-year design for the network is necessary even at this stage to handle the crisscrossing of different lines, all based on the traffic count of where and what time commuters are taking the ride and where they will disembark. This comprehensive study will determine how the intersecting trains will crisscross one another to determine the optimal design of stations. (See sample cross-section designs.) Finally, some people worry about earthquakes. Other cities with miles of subways are much more earthquake-prone than Manila. It is just a matter of engineering and route selection to avoid active fault lines. It will cost a little bit more to design and build the tunnels when passing near suspected active faults. Metro Manila is fortunate to have an ideal subsoil condition. It sits on Guadalupe Tuff, a type of adobe that is ideal for tunneling. (Glicerio V.

2014-10-26,,,,"MANILA, Philippines  Following the crackdown of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on private vehicles servicing commuters through the mobile application Uber, Malacaang on Sunday said the government still needs to study how to address the problem. Perhaps we need to study this issue because this method of getting transportation used by our citizens is already being debated upon in other countries, Communications Secretary Herminio Coloma Jr. said over state-run Radyo ng Bayan. Uber is a ridesharing service that allows passengers to connect with drivers through a smartphone application. Taxi drivers in some countries oppose the service, claiming that it allows illegal taxicab operations. Last week, the LTFRB apprehended a driver using the app, acting on a complaint from the Philippine National Taxi Operators Association (PNTOA). Coloma said that Uber has already caused massive protests in Europe because of the transport unions opposition although it posed no problems in the United States. Here in our country, the LTFRB is looking into its implications because under our law, those who want to offer public transport should secure a franchise from the LTFRB. And the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) is the LTFRBs partner in implementing the law, he explained. Coloma said it is important that the peoples transport needs are addressed in accordance with the law. He said the government also wants to ensure the safety of the public.

2014-10-26,,,,"MANILA, Philippines - After apprehending a partner driver of Uber, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board is training its sights on other taxi service providers, LTFRB chair Winston Ginez said yesterday. The LTFRB chair cried foul over criticisms, especially in social media, that the government was resisting innovation. It appears that we are stopping or cannot keep up with technology but thats not the case, Ginez said, adding that the government is not against technology but taxi service providers should operate within the law. While the board is open to meeting with representatives of Uber, Ginez said they would not back down on their argument that such service providers should use franchised vehicles. These providers should either partner with existing franchised taxicabs or stop operating, Ginez said. The LTFRB chair likened Ubers operation to the work of a barker at a terminal. He noted that while there was nothing wrong with the operation, it should involve vehicles that have existing franchises, lest it be apprehended for colorum violation. Ginez said the board is reviewing the operation of other mobile apps like Easy Taxi and Grab Taxi. The difference between these two and Uber is that they partnered with franchised taxi units, he said. According to Ginez, their concern over the operations of Easy Taxi and Grab Taxi is the additional charge they impose on top of the taxi fare. Ginez said they will study whether this needs to be regulated. These (innovations in transportation services) are all new. There has been no precedent case, he said. But Ginez said there should be no mistake on the need to follow the franchise law. Joint Administrative Order 2014-01 recently released by the LTFRB and the Land Transportation Office imposes higher fines on traffic violations, including colorum operations. Colorum operation for taxicabs is punishable with P200,000. Earlier, Uber regional manager for Southeast Asia and Australia Mike Brown expressed disappointment over the LTFRBs action against the technology service that is better for riders, drivers and the community. Brown said Uber has been embraced in 222 cities in 45 countries.

2014-10-27,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesThe Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) has directed all contractors with ongoing projects to suspend all road excavation activities, and to clear the roads of construction barriers and equipment before the All Saints Day break. Also in preparation for next weekends holidays, the Philippine National Police (PNP) will deploy road safety marshals on major thoroughfares and streets leading to cemeteries. In an advisory, the DPWH over the weekend also called for the brief suspension of government road projects for the duration of the public holidays. The department instructed its district engineers to coordinate with contractors and project engineers of the United Project Management Office in rescheduling public infrastructure projects. Public Works Secretary Rogelio Singson advised contractors with ongoing projects to temporarily suspend their road excavation and pavement removal activities. They should also start removing construction barriers and idle equipment on site that may obstruct and affect the traffic flow, he said. Singson ordered DPWH personnel to put up the necessary traffic warning signs along national roads. This, he said, will ensure better and safer travel of motorists and commuters. From Oct. 30 to Nov. 3, the agency will activate its Lakbay Alalay, or travel assistance program along national roads nationwide. Under the public service program, DPWH personnel will be ready to respond to road emergency situations in coordination with the PNP, Land Transportation Office and local government units. The PNP itself will field marshals from the Highway Patrol Group (HPG) to assist motorists and commuters expected to go home to their provinces to visit cemeteries and memorial parks where their loved ones are buried. The marshals will be deployed until the vacationers return home from their respective provinces. PNP spokesman Senior Supt. Wilben Mayor said the PNP would also set up public assistance centers to be manned by the local police and the HPG. PNP Director General Alan Purisima said policemen would be also securing churches, cemeteries and tourist spots for people taking advantage of the long holidays. The entire PNP will be placed on full alert to provide maximum coverage and public safety services, which is what we always implement during holidays and special events, Purisima said. Thousands of Metro Manila residents are expected to flock to bus terminals and other transport hubs before the weekend. In Metro Manila, large cemeteries like the Manila North and South cemeteries usually have huge numbers of visitors. Mayor said unit commanders had been instructed to plan their assistance strategies for physically disabled visitors in cemeteries and terminals. They will need more attention from our public servants for them to feel safer and more secure as they visit their departed ones, the spokesperson said. Purisima said the PNP would not be neglecting its intelligence, counterintelligence and police operations to preempt terrorist and criminal activities. Regional police commanders have been directed to provide security coverage to power plants, telecommunication relay stations and other vital installations.

2014-10-27,,,,"MANILA - Lawmakers are taking up the cudgels for users of mobile car service app ''Uber'', which has been the subject of a crackdown by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). Kabataan party-list Rep. Terry Ridon said the LTFRB should reconsider its position on suspending the operations of Uber. ""While this innovative transport service app may indeed be violating portions of the Public Service Law by tapping private vehicles for public land transportation without securing a franchise, there is no denying that the app offers a new level of convenience for the riding public using available technologies,"" he said in a statement. The LTFRB recently held a crackdown on vehicles affiliated with Uber, a mobile application that allows users to book private vehicles, with services mostly available in the cities of Makati and Pasig. Acting on a complaint filed by the Philippine National Taxi Operators Association, the LTFRB started going after Uber vehicles last week and ordered the suspension of its services. The LTFRB argues that Uber-affiliated vehicles still need franchises in order to operate. Apart from Uber, the LTFRB is also eyeing on regulating the operation of another app, GrabTaxi, which allows users to book cabs near them. Ridon said technology and government regulation need not clash with each other. ""LTFRB should find means for Uber to operate legally. It can, for example, explore the possibility of issuing special permits for Uber vehicles like what it did not so long ago for Makati buses that pick up Makati-based employees from MRT stations."" ""Passengers are using apps like Uber and GrabTaxi precisely because of the decrepit state of public transportation in our cities. LTFRB might be correct in asserting its regulatory power over Uber, yet it should not hamper the development of such alternative modes of transportation. Instead, it should find ways to let Uber operate legally."" Valenzuela City Rep. Sherwin Gatchalian, meanwhile, wants the LTFRB to create a special accreditation procedure for Uber-affiliated vehicles instead of making it difficult for the online transportation service. ""I suggest that LTFRB create a special procedure for the Uber providers instead of making it difficult for them. These providers provide a special service that the common carriers cannot fulfill. There is big demand for their type of service,"" said Gatchalian, a stalwart of the Nationalist Peoples Coalition (NPC). Gatchalian pointed out that Uber is not competing with the regular taxis since the online service is catering to high-end clients. Uber, which operates in 45 countries, launched its services in Manila last March. The service allows users to share a ride or hail private vehicles through its mobile app. Uber's roster of service vehicles include units of Toyota Fortuner, Mitsubishi Montero, Toyota Camry and even the bulky Hummer. Gatchalian said the LTFRB should prepare itself for more technology-driven public transport system and that LTFRB Chairman Winston Ginez should now consider putting up an office that will study and manage technology-driven platforms. ""The LTFRB should embrace technology and not kill it. We will see more of these type of mobile applications and crowd-sourcing in future since high-end and discriminating clients want clean, safe and efficient public transport system. Uber fulfills this need to clients who want to pay the premium,"" said Gatchalian, a majority member of the House committee on Metro Manila development. Gatchalian said the entry of Uber is a challenge to all taxi operators and drivers to improve their service. ""Technology will always find a way to fill in the gap."" Under Section 15 of the Public Service Act, no public service shall operate in the Philippines without possessing a valid and subsisting certificate from the appropriate board. In the case of public utility vehicles like the local units of Uber, the LTFRB is the governing board. Gatchalian pointed out that the owners of Uber application do not need to secure a franchise because the application merely facilittes the booking process. ""Those who provide the taxi service or Uber service, however, must secure a franchise because they are functioning as a common carrier as provided under current jurisprudence,"" said Gatchalian.",,"By RG Cruz, ABS-CBN News",House Representative,yes,2014-10-27 00:00:00,"formulation of legislationlocal ordinances,new modes of transportation",,,,,,,,english,,http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/10/27/14/amid-uber-crackdown-ltfrb-told-embrace-innovation,,"makati, valenzuela, metro manila, manila, pasig",text,,443.0,,1989.0,,candice,,,"policy and legislation, alternative transportation",5.5,Straight News,,,,,,abs-cbnnews,no,no,,,,"Amid 'Uber' crackdown, LTFRB told to embrace innovation",Neutral,,

Modesto Floranda, president of Piston  National Capital Region, said the fines prescribed under the Joint Administrative Order 2014-01 of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) and the Land Transportation Office (LTO), are too much for public utility drivers who earn little. Floranda said not all members of Piston were being forced to join the strike. Piston president George San Mateo earlier said the transport strike will take place in Metro Manila, Laguna, Albay, Iloilo, Bacolod, Cebu, Northern Mindanao, Surigao Del Norte, General Santos and Davao City. Piston has about 200,000 members, 30,000 of whom are in Metro Manila. A petition has been filed before the Supreme Court assailing the legality of the joint administrative order. Under the order, the penalties for colorum vehicles are pegged at P1 million for buses, P200,000 for trucks, P50,000 for jeepneys, P200,000 for vans, P120,000 for taxis, and P6,000 for tricyles for first offenses.

Additional 41,602 police personnel will be deployed to convergence areas nationwide as the entire PNP force enters full alerton October 30as part of its Ligtas Undas security plan. In a press briefing at Camp Crame, Interior Secretary Manuel Mar Roxas II said the PNPs operation plan (Oplan) will be effectiveuntil Nov. 3, when people are expected to go back from their furlough. As the full alert starts on Thursday, Roxas said 4,034 additional policemen will be sent in each region across the country. All leaves will be canceled. Extended hours for PNP personnel in all stations will be observed. Their usual 8 to 12 hours duty will have additional 50-percent duty for increased police presence, Roxas said. PNPs maneuver units, such as the special action forces, regional public safety battalions, and provincial public safety companies, will be on standby for deployment24/7. Aside from policemen, the Department of Interior and Local Government also tapped civilian volunteers, radio communication groups and barangay (village) peacekeeping action teams to serve as force multipliers. The key areas include cemeteries, places of worship, vital installations, tourist destinations, air and sea ports, bus terminals, and all transportation hubs nationwide. In Metro Manila, some 2,456 MMDA traffic enforcers, medical teams, clean-up crews will be sent in all cemeteries and memorial parks. The MMDA enforcers will aid 4,278 National Capital Region Police Office personnel with 2,595 concentrated in cemeteries, 279 in bus terminals, 606 in vital installations, 217 in places of worship, 200 in major tourist destinations, 158 in route security, 100 in malls, 61 in airports, and eight in sea ports. According to MMDA chairman Francis Tolentino, the MMDAs Oplan Kaluluwa has been ironed out by the agency in cooperation with the metropolis 16 cities and municipality. Tolentino said the contingency plan will be effectivestarting October 27 at 2 p.m. until November 3 at 8 p.m. Anticipating the surge of bus passengers in terminals, enforcers were tasked to man terminals including those in Araneta Center, Cubao and in Mindanao Avenue in Quezon City; Edsa terminals in Cubao, Pasay, and Balintawak; Dangwa in Sampaloc, Manila, and in Southwest Integrated Provincial Terminal in Paranaque City. Fielded in major roads and sidewalks to oversee traffic safety are roving teams from the MMDAs Traffic Discipline Office. Ambulances and Public Assistance Center tents for emergency medical services will be set up at the four major cemeteriesManila South Cemetery, Manila North Cemetery, Loyola Memorial Park and Manila Memorial Park. Ensuring maximum personnel deployment, Tolentino also reminded that enforcers must observe the no day-off and no-absent policy while the Oplan Kaluluwa is effective. In 2013, eight criminal incidents in the country were reportedfrom Oct. 31 to Nov. 2. According to Roxas, the PNP and other agencies are doing their best to prevent crime but they are also preparing for the worst. Hindi tayo nagpapabaya at patuloy na nakaalerto ang PNP, he said.

Two other organizations, however, stood firm on their decision to go on strike indefinitely until Mayor Joseph Estrada and other officials back down from enforcing City Ordinance No. 8336. On the first day of the city governments implementation of the expanded truck ban Monday, traffic was light in the streets of Manila as truckers did not ply their routes as they had earlier threatened. As early as 2 a.m., the citys traffic police together with Vice Mayor Francisco Isko Domagoso stationed themselves on Roxas Boulevard to accost violators. They were later joined by Estrada who had donned his camouflage uniform, the same outfit he wore in August when the city government implemented a ban on Manila-bound passenger buses without a franchise and terminals. Estrada and the police went head to head with members of the Integrated North Harbor Truckers Association (INHTA) who had parked their trucks in front of the Moriones gate of the Manila North Harbor Terminal on R10 in Tondo to protest the expanded truck ban. INHTA officers took the opportunity to explain why they were opposed to the new policy which bans eight-wheelers and vehicles with a gross weight of above 4,500 kilograms from plying the citys streets between 5 a.m. and 9 p.m. According to them, the shorter hours would adversely affect their operations and the economy as well. They also said that the concession offered by the Manila governmenta window period between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. which would be in effect for the next six to eight monthswould not give them enough time to complete their deliveries. A tug of war ensued when Estrada ordered the protesters trucks towed and some rallyists crawled under the vehicles to prevent these from being driven away. They were, however, dragged out by policemen as tow trucks took their vehicles away. In a breakfast meeting with Estrada, Domagoso, MMDA Chair Francis Tolentino, Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board Executive Director Roberto Cabrera III and Philippine Ports Authority officials at Aloha Hotel in Ermita, representatives of the trucker groups once again expressed their concern over the ban. Rodolfo de Ocampo, chair of the Confederation of Truckers Association of the Philippines (CTAP) said that even with the window period, it would be hard for them to complete their operations especially with the turnaround time which usually takes about an hour or more. CTAP chair emeritus and former national police chief Edgardo Aglipay also expressed concern that arriving goods would be stockpiled at the ports because of the shorter operating hours for truckers. Why dont we give it first a try and when we encounter major problems, then we can meet again and consider other options? Estrada told them, adding that the move was for the good of the majority, especially commuters. In the end, CTAP, which claims to have 4,000 members, agreed to comply with the new truck ban but under the condition that a committee be formed to discuss the agreements made during the meeting. This included providing their members with holding areas for their vehicles so that they would not have to park their trucks on the roads before they enter the ports. But hours after the consultation, around 100 members of the Alliance of Concerned Truck Owners and Organizations gathered at their office inside the Manila International Container Terminal to announce that they would continue to observe a truck holiday. It will be up to the city government to act on their request that it go back to the old truck ban so that normal port operations could resume, they added. Under the old system, trucks were banned in the citys streets from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. and between 3 p.m. and 9 p.m.",Maricar B.

2014-10-28,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesA professor from the University of the Philippines (UP) reported a road rage incident in Quezon City on Monday that left her and her family members traumatized and fearing for their lives. This was after an initial police investigation showed that the man who drew a gun to confront them during the traffic altercation was using a vehicle allegedly belonging to the family of an incumbent town mayor in Bulacan province. In a complaint filed in the Quezon City Police Districts Criminal Investigation and Detection Unit (QCPD-CIDU), the professorwho requested not to be named in this report for security reasonssaid she and her family members were in their vehicle passing through Congressional Road when they encountered the gun-toting man. The man got off from a silver Toyota Innova (ZEL-124). Records from the Land Transportation Office (LTO), which were obtained later in the day by investigators, showed that the Innova is registered to Priscilla Francisco Meneses, mother of Mayor Patrick Meneses of Bulacan, Bulacan. The Inquirer tried to reach Mayor Meneses for comment, but the calls and text messages sent to his mobile phone remained unanswered at press time. The UP professor was then in a Fortuner with her 19-year-old son, her daughter-in-law, her two small grandchildren and their nannies, on their way to Himlayang Pilipino memorial park to visit the tombs of relatives ahead of All Saints Day. When a white Land Cruiser (PQS-904) suddenly overtook the Fortuner driven by the professors son, she told him to just move to another lane and avoid the other reckless driver. But the Land Cruiser overtook them for the second time, and it became clear that it was part of a convoy that also included the silver Innova. As the Innova appeared to be moving to also overtake the Fortuner, it instead ran side by side with the professors vehicle. It was at this point that a male passenger in the Innova rolled down his window and began hurling invectives at the professors son. Cant you see that were escorting someone?! the man said, according to the complaint. The Innova then increased its speed and cut the path of the Fortuner. As both vehicles stopped in the middle of the road, the man got off the Innova, this time with a pistol in hand. Seeing the gun, the professor yelled at the man that she had children onboard, prompting him to go back to his vehicle. The Innova then sped off. We just wanted a peaceful day, the professors husband, also a UP professor, later told the Inquirer after learning about the incident from his wife. According to the LTO records, the Land Cruiser is registered to Mactan Construction Supply, a company based on N. Domingo Street, San Juan City. RELATED STORIES",Jaymee T.

2014-02-26,,,,"Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada has agreed to make adjustments in the newly implemented citywide daytime truck ban policy following a meeting with Interior Secretary Mar Roxas on Wednesday. An exclusive report on 24 Oras said Estrada agreed to be more lenient in the implementation of the truck ban following the meeting with Roxas and Quezon City Mayor Herbert Bautista at the Manila City Hall. Free-flowing na for loaded trucks, Estrada said in the report. Under the proposed adjustment, trucks loaded with deliveries are exempted from the ban from Mondays to Saturdays as long as they use designated routes. For trucks without cargo, there will be a window time where they could use Manila's roads from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., Mondays to Saturdays. There will also be a designated lane along Roxas Blvd. for trucks, the report said. The adjustments will be formalized in a new ordinance that the city council will pass. The meeting occurred after trucker groups protested the truck ban policy by not rolling out on Monday. These groups argued that the ban will affect the production schedule of some factories in the country. Under the contested policy, which began implementation on Monday, trucks are banned to ply the streets from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m., Mondays through Saturdays. However, they are given a window period to travel from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Offenders will face a fine of P5,000, plus the towing of their trucks. Roxas, meanwhile, was pleased with proposed adjustment. Well, actually maganda 'yung pag free-flowing dahil mas mabilis ang labas-pasok ng mga produkto at tsaka pati yung mga tsuper mismo makaka-two trips sila or kahit baka three trips pa. 'Di naman puwede na nasa traffic lang sila, he said. For his part, Bautista, who chairs the Metro Manila Council, gave Estrada a letter from the Metro Manila Development Authority chairman Francis Tolentino. In the letter, Tolentino expressed his support for the truck ban but asked Estrada to give it a 15-day testing period and make needed adjustments afterward.

In an advisory, Malacaang said Mr. Aquino would begin his inspection this afternoon. He will first be at the North Port Passenger Terminal Complex at the Manila North Harbour Port and then proceed to the Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 3 in Pasay City. This will be followed by a trip to the JAC Liners Buendia Terminal and the DLTB Nirvana-LRT Buendia Terminal, both in Pasay City. Malacaang has yet to announce when President Aquino would visit the graves of his parentsdemocracy icons Sen. Benigno Aquino Jr. and the late President Corazon Aquino, who are buried at the Manila Memorial Park in Paraaque City. The President has been making an annual inspection of the terminal and transport hubs, which are crowded with people returning to their hometowns to pay their respects to their departed loved ones.

2014-10-31,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesWith roads near the airport expected to be congested this All Saints Day weekend, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) has provided alternate routes and opened a zipper lane for motorists going to the airports. MMDA Chair Francis Tolentino said the agency expects heavy traffic along roads near the airports starting today until Sunday since many would be going home to the provinces. He noted that an estimated 42,000 passengers would flock to the airport during weekend. We also considered the ongoing construction of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (Naia) Elevated Expressway Phase 2 which will surely cause vehicle jam near the airports, he added. Tolentino also noted that the airport is adjacent to three major cemeteries in Metro Manila (Manila Memorial Park and Loyola Memorial Park in Paraaque and the Pasay City Public Cemetery) where big crowds are expected. The traffic plan calls for vehicles to be allowed to turn left from Andrews Avenue to Tramo/Edsa to decongest the route to Naia Terminal 3 from Andrews. A zipper lane along the southbound lane of Tramo Road opened on Thursday from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. and from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. for vehicles going to Terminal 3 so that they can avoid the lane in front of the Pasay cemetery. Neomie Recio, MMDA Traffic Engineering head, said one lane would be opened near the rotunda in front of the Villamor Hospital for U-turning vehicles going to the Skyway and Sales Interchange. Aside from these measures, the MMDA also proposed alternate routes to avoid heavy traffic in going to the airport. Vehicles from Cavite and Las Pias City can take the service road from Don Galo to Naia Road to reach the airport. Motorists are also advised to use the Airport Road instead of the Naia Road if they are coming from Roxas Boulevard going to Terminal 3 and the Domestic Terminal. According to Tolentino, another fast way to get to the Terminals 1 and 2 from Magallanes in Makati City is to use the Skyway then head to the Bicutan Exit toward Doa Soledad which will take motorists to E. Rodriguez, to Kaingin Road then to Multinational Village which leads directly to Terminals 1 and 2. If you are going to use this alternate route, it will take you only about 45 minutes to reach the international airport terminal from Magallanes, Tolentino told the media during the test ride along the substitute route on Thursday. The MMDA chair explained that these traffic measures became effective since Thursday and would be observed until Nov. 3. If these measures succeed in decongesting traffic near the airports, the plan would be continued until the Christmas holiday and maybe even until 2016 since the Naia Expressway is expected to be finished that year, he explained. Tolentino also advised those who will be traveling to the airports to leave their houses four to five hours before their scheduled flights to avoid being caught in heavy traffic. He assured motorists that a total of 115 traffic constables will be deployed along roads near the airports starting Friday until Nov. 3.",,"8:00 AM | Friday, October 31st, 2014",,yes,2014-10-31 00:00:00,"reports on traffic congestion,traffic advisories,traffic management schemes",,,,,,,,english,no,http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/647982/flying-out-mmda-clears-route-to-airport,,"cavite, metro manila, makati, manila, roxas, pasay",text,,553.0,,388.0,,pia,,,traffic congestion,5.0,Straight News,,,,,,inquirer,no,,,,,Flying out?

The President has made it his task to inspect terminals and air and sea ports on occasions when passengers leave the metropolis en masse. Government has always been taken to task for the string of bus accidents that have taken place, resulting in deaths. Communications Secretary Herminio Coloma Jr. told reporters that the President was happy seeing everything in place. The preparation and what ought to be done to ensure the safety of the people was obvious [to the President], Coloma said. Coloma said the President asked the Coast Guard only to deploy more K9 as an additional security and precautionary measure at the North Port Passenger Terminal Complex at the Manila North Harbor, Mr. Aquinos first stop. The President also boarded the MV St. Leo the Great bound for Cebu. Coloma said Mr. Aquino noticed that there were pieces of luggage blocking the emergency exit and asked the crew to ensure that all emergency lanes were clear of obstruction. Aside from that, he was happy with the orderliness that he saw and that all facilities were prepared for the influx of passengers. There was no congestion, and our public appeared comfortable, Coloma said. Coloma said that after inspecting the airport named after his father, the President gave instructions that all X-ray machines should be in good working condition so that cargo and luggage are properly inspected. From the airport, Mr. Aquino and his entourage motored to the JAC Liner and DLTB Buendia terminals at the corner of Buendia and Taft Avenue in Pasay City. There, the President took the chance to mingle with the public, giving out baller IDs to the crowd and shaking hands with them. He also boarded two passenger buses, one of which was headed to Sta. Cruz, Laguna.

2014-02-26,,,,"MANILA, Philippines  There will be no roadblocks for Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada in implementing the day-time truck ban even if truckers hold a strike in delivering the goods in and out of the capital. In an interview with Inquirer Radio 990AM, Estrada said that the truckers were only thinking about themselves and they would not bat an eye on the effects of their action to the citizens of Manila. They are only thinking about themselves, and their pay, Estrada said Wednesday afternoon. They do not think about the obstruction that they cause on the citizens. Estrada said that he does not believe the truckers claims of a profit loss that the day-time truck ban caused them. The truck ban would only give the truckers a window from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. He added that all the timetables and windows regarding the day-time truck ban were heard in four meetings with Secretary Rogelio Singson of the Department of Public Works and Highways and Chairman Francis Tolentino of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority. Bert Suansing, president of the Integrated Truckers Association, however took the contrary in Estradas claims. He said that their losses, and the other sectors problems, were true and that the day-time truck ban was the culprit in their trade problems. The losses of other sectors have a connection to the transfer and delivery of goods, there are so much money lost since the goods are stranded on the ports, Suansing said. He added that it was not only businesses in Manila which were affected. The day-time truck ban, he said, ran over businesses in neighboring provinces in Central, Northern and Southern Luzon. A similar truck-ban, Suansing claimed, was implemented in 1991 but was also scrapped as it did not benefit the businesses. Estrada said that in their meetings with the truckers, the truck ban would be implemented from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. and trucks would only be allowed to take the roads in the remaining hours. He added that even if a truck was still in the road when the clock turns to 5 am, no charges would be filed as long as the truck is carrying cargo. No one would be apprehended, as long as they are going to the warehouses and they are carrying cargo, Estrada said. For the part of the truckers, Suansing said that they wish Estrada would give them a special lane that the trucks would occupy for the whole day, even during the truck-ban hours. He added that the special lanes would be used to transport goods through North Luzon Expressway, South Luzon Expressway, and Cavite Expressway.

Alvarez, who spoke at an Interfaith Conference on Climate Change in Talisay City in the morning, was heading for San Carlos City to visit the solar fields there when the accident happened at 3:15 p.m. John Ci-O, 38, driver of the Mitsubishi Montero Sports vehicle owned by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, tried to overtake a motorcycle but instead, the SUV hit the front wheel and the side of a truck parked on the left lane of the road, said Senior Police Officer 1 Danilo Pastro of the Murcia police. Negros Occidental Vice Governor Eugenio Jose Lacson, who was headed for Bacolod from San Carlos, passed by shortly after the accident and saw the wrecked Montero in the middle of the road and stopped to help. Alvarez, 75, and his assistant Bernadette Felix, 50 who were both seated at the back, were able to walk to Lacsons vehicle. Lacson told the Philippine Daily Inquirer that Felix complained about having difficulty in breathing and had a bump in the back of the head. While Alvarez didnt have any visible wounds, the vice governor said Lacson was worried that he may be suffering from internal bleeding. Alvarez spat out a little blood, the vice governor said. The two were taken to Pablo O. Torre Medical Center where they underwent several tests and X-ray. Ci-O and Raffy Taguihanon, 35, were unharmed, said the police. Taguihanon said their vehicle was traveling at 120 kilometers an hour when Ci-O suddenly stepped on the brakes to avoid hitting a motorcycle. The Montero Sports instead hit a parked 10-wheeler truck. Taguihanon said he and the driver were not hurt because of the airbags in the front seat. Taguihanon said Felix had a bump on the back of her head and wound in the mouth, while Alvarez appeared to be shaken and needed oxygen.

2014-11-04,,,,"Several traffic enforcers were caught on CCTV apparently extracting bribes from trucks in Paranaque City, GMA News' ""24 Oras"" reported on Tuesday.  In the video shown, a traffic enforcer seemed to asked a truck driver for his license while sternly telling him off.  But the traffic enforcer hid the license under his ticket pad before returning the license to the driver, quickly dismissing him without issuing a ticket.  He then returned to two of his cohorts, giving a ""hi-five"" to one traffic enforcer and shaking the hand of another who appeared to slip something into his gloves after they touched hands.  The same traffic enforcer apprehended another truck driver, who tried handing him something that didn't appear to be his license.  The enforcer rejected the object, but readily accepted the license the driver handed in its place. The traffic enforcer repeated the same procedure as he did with the previous truck driver.  According to MMDA Public Concerns Chief Goddess Hope Libiran, traffic enforcers must issue tickets after asking for license.  Traffic enforcers are also forbidden from wearing clothing which would conceal their uniform during arrests.     ""Yung mga cameras namin, lagi nga naming sinasabi sa mga enforcers ng MMDA hindi yan nandiyan para takutin na mag-ingat sila sa mga ginagawa nila. Nilagay namin para maging reminder sa kanila na 'wag silang gumawa ng kahit anong kalokohan,"" Libiran said.  Despite the video evidence, the Paranaque Traffic Management Office head insisted that Traffic Enforcer II was not part of the force.  They added that they changed uniforms to prevent further incidents of kotong to occur in the area.

Sa ulat ni Jay Sabale sa GMA News TV's nitong Martes, sinabing naganap ang aksidente sa panulukan ng Speaker Perez St. at N. Roxas sa barangay Lourdes. Sa kuha ng closed-circuit television camera sa lugar na pinangyarihan ng sakuna, makikita ang nakalagay na ""X-Box"" sa gitna ng kalsada na nagbibigay babala sa mga motorista na dapat huminto muna ang mga sasakyan sa iba't ibang direksiyon bilang pag-iingat. Pero ang isang school service van ng Xavier School, makikitang dumiretso sa intersection at nag-ilaw lamang pero hindi nagmenor sa takbo, at nasalpok na ang isa pang school van. Sa inisyal na imbestigasyon ng pulisya, nasa siyam ang sugatan sa aksidente, kabilang ang dalawang driver ng mga school service, at apat na estudyante. Sa hiwalay na ulat ng GMA News TV's , sinabing kabilang sa mga nasaktan sa aksidente ang anak ng aktor na si Dennis Trillo at Carlene Aguilar na si Caliz; isang pang mag-aaral mula sa Ramon Magsaysay High School; at isang mag-aaral mula sa Esteban Abada High School. Mabilis namang dumating ang ilang residente para tulungan ang mga biktima na dinala sa Sta. Teresita Hospital sa Q.C. para magamot. Ang apat na estudyante ng Xavier school, inilipat sa Chinese General Hospital. Giit ng driver ng service van na si Jerry Lito Papa, Pagdating ko rito, ang tulin nito [isa pang school service]. Naghahabulan itong dalawa. Yung isa, nakaalpas na, ito naiwan. Eh humabol pa. Tinamaan kami.  Depensa naman ni Ramsur Padios, driver ng isa pang service, Ipi-pick up namin yung isang pasahero diyan. Nung paakyat na kami dito, dahan-dahan lang ang takbo ko tapos siya ang biglang sumulpot tapos biglang binangga 'yung harapan namin. Sa lakas [ng impact], sa tulin ng takbo niya, dito kami tumilapon sa kabilang kanto.""  Ayon kay PO3 Jonathan Jimenez, kasalukuyang nag-iikot ang pulisya sa mga ospital upang malaman ang wastong bilang ng mga nasaktan sa insidente. Nakatutok din ang PNP sa imbestigasyon upang matukoy ang may-sala.  Dagdag pa ni Jimenez, maaaring maharap sa kasong reckless imprudence resulting to damage to property at multiple physical injuries ang mapapatunayang naging sanhi ng aksidente.  Iniimbestigahan na rin ng Land Transportation Franchising & Regulatory Board (LTFRB) ang nasabing insidente.  Paglilinaw ni NCR Regional Director Rodolfo Jaucian, pasado sa year model at specifications ang dalawang school service.  Dagdag pa ng pamunuan ng Xavier School, mayroong 10 outsource na school service ang Xavier, pero kumpleto naman daw ang mga ito sa insurance at papeles.  Gayunpaman, sa oras na mapatunayan ang may sala, maaari itong mapatawan ng multa o suspensyon ng LTFRB.  Pinag-aaralan pa raw ng mga magulang ng mga mag-aaral na nasaktan kung magsasampa sila ng kaso laban sa mga operator ng school service.  Sa ngayon, ipinauubaya muna nila sa pamunuan ng Xavier School ang aksiyon kaugnay sa insidente.  Nais rin umano nila na maging mas mahigpit ang patakaran pagdating sa safety ng school service. Panawagan ng mga magulang sa LTFRB, pagibayuhin pa ang pagpapatupad ng pagsusuot ng seatbelt.  Hinihintay naman ng pamunuan ng Xavier School ang pinal na resulta ng imbestigasyon. Siniguro rin nito na matutugunan ang pangangailangan ng mga bata sa ospital. -- ",Bianca Rose Dabu,,"Philippine National Police, Academic institutions, LTFRB",yes,2014-11-04 00:00:00,road crashes,,2.0,9.0,"name: Jerry Lito Papa; profession: school service driver; ridergroup: school service driver; age: adult; gender: male; /

2014-11-04,,,,"MANILA - Despite an imposed moratorium, the government might consider issuing franchises to vehicles affiliated with online cab provider Uber. Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) chair Winston Ginez said this was one of the options they were looking into as they are set to meet with representatives of Uber. There is currently a moratorium on franchises issued to taxicabs. According to Ginez, it will be up to the Department of Transportation and Communications to decide whether the government would grant franchises to Uber-affiliated vehicles. The DOTC is the mother agency of the LTFRB. In a recent statement, DOTC Secretary Joseph Emilio Abaya told the LTFRB to work together with Uber. Abaya said transportation regulations should facilitate convenient, safe and reliable services to the public, not hamper them. Abaya issued the statement after the LTFRB was criticized for apprehending an affiliate vehicle of Uber for colorum operations. According to Ginez, they were still finalizing the schedule of the meeting. During the meeting, Ginez said, the board and the DOTC would listen to Uber representatives on issues concerning their operations. Ginez has said in the past that the board would not apprehend the vehicles if Uber only tapped cabs with existing franchises.

Bukod kay Calix, nagtamo naman ng sugat sa katawan ang ibang mag-aral mula sa Xavier School-Greenhills na kasama niya sa sasakyan. Sa hiwalay na ulat ni Steve Dailisan sa GMA News TV's sinabing isang grade 7 student ang halos hindi makatayo dahil natamaan ito sa balakang. Mayroon din itong sugat sa noo, kamay at braso.  Kuwento naman ng ina ng isa sa mga nasaktang estudyante, masuwerte daw at nakasuot ito ng jacket dahil lumusot ang bata sa likurang salamin ng school service.  Sugatan din sa insidente ang ina ng isang grade 2 student na si Cristina Go, na kasama ang anak sa harapang bahagi ng school service nang mangyari ang banggaan sa Barangay Lourdes.  Pinag-aaralan pa ng mga magulang ng mga mag-aaral kung magsasampa sila ng kaso laban sa operators at mga driver ng school service.  Sa ngayon, ipinauubaya muna nila sa pamunuan ng Xavier School ang aksiyon kaugnay sa insidente.  Nais rin nila na maging mas mahigpit ang patakaran pagdating sa safety ng school service.  Nanawagan din ang mga magulang sa LTFRB na pag-ibayuhin pa ang patakaran na obligahin ang mga sasakyan na magkaroon seatbelt.  Hinihintay naman ng pamunuan ng Xavier School ang pinal na resulta ng imbestigasyon. Siniguro rin nito na matutugunan ang pangangailangan ng mga bata sa ospital.   Nitong Martes, nag-post din ng ilang mensahe at larawan si Carlene sa kaniyang Twitter account upang ihayag ang saloobin sa nangyaring sakuna sa anak.  Nagpapasalamat si Carlene na bukol at gasgas lang ang tinamo ni Calix sa nangyaring banggaan.  Saad nito sa kaniyang post: ""This happened kanina sa school service ng anak ko...buti nalang at gasgas at bukol lang sa ulo meron ang anak ko ...sana lang tlga managot ang mga dapat managot at dapat hindi mabilis magpatakbo ang mga school bus drivers dahil may mga pasahero silang mga bata..... thank you Lord safe anak ko pero im still praying sa mga batang lubhang nasugatan sa aksidenteng ito! #huwagtularan #notorecklessdrivers.""

2014-11-08,,,"Vehicle users, Public officials, Government agencies","More than half of the world's population now lives in cities. There are many benefits that come from millions of people living, working, and interacting in close proximity to one another. Traffic, however, is not one of them. More than just an annoyance that impacts quality of life, chronic traffic congestion can be bad for the economy and the environment. In June 2014, the Philippines National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) released a roadmap for traffic infrastructure development in Metro Manila and nearby areas saying that the Philippines lost around P2.4 billion every day in 2012 because of the traffic congestion. The report also forecast that the losses may increase to P6 billion a day come 2030. The environment is not to be spared in such predicament as JICAs report also shared that 4.79 million tons of gas emissions a year was recorded in the Philippines due to the severe traffic jams in 2012, which may climb to 5.72 million tons in 2030. By mid-century, the percentage of people living in cities worldwide is projected to grow to 75%, placing further stress on roadways. Simply adding additional lanes to roadways is not a viable path forward. Fortunately, cities have other options at their disposal to help tackle and tame urban traffic congestion. They also have access to sophisticated software tools that can help simulate the impact of these solutions before anything is built. This allows urban planners to experiment with multiple scenarios and select the best mix of solutions to address their traffic woes. Bus rapid transit (BRT) varies from region to region, but it typically involves creating a dedicated lane for buses on surface roads, so that buses can move large amounts of people from point A to point B more quickly. Several South American cities, including Bogota, Colombia, have had notable success with BRT. This is why it is good that the World Bank has recently approved a financial package to facilitate the implementation of the Philippines first bus rapid transit (BRT) in Cebu. As with any transit decision, a tradeoff is involved: if you put in a BRT lane, you lose a lane for cars. Software models can help analyze the transit network as a whole to show how many more riders a stretch of road could carry with a BRT system in place and how much time could potentially be shaved off of daily commutes. Nobody likes sitting at a red lightespecially when no cross-traffic is using the green light. Adaptive traffic lights vary their signals in real time to improve traffic flow. And these adaptive traffic lights are hardly just for private cars. Remember our bus rapid transit system? Adaptive traffic light systems can be designed to give BRT buses green lights if theyre running behind schedule so that they can catch up. The result? More reliable BRT service, which encourages ridership. This may sound counterintuitive, but when traffic becomes very busy, you can actually get more through put if you slow everyone down a bit. Metered entrances at highway on-ramps  or similar meters along the roadwaycontrol the speed dynamic and help prevent the start-stop traffic that tends to create traffic jams. Active traffic management systems have been implemented in several countriesincluding Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United Statesand demonstrate how technology can increase the capacity of a fixed stretch of road. Used to great success in places like London and Singapore, congestion tolls offer another way for cities to get more capacity out of an existing road. By charging people a toll to drive into the city center, congestion tolls create an incentive for people to carpool, so that the road carries more people per hour than it normally would. Of course, people can still drive by themselves if they wish to pay for the privilege. Fortunately, the revenue generated by these drivers often goes towards towards road repairs and improvements. Bikes take up less space than cars, which means that you can fit more bicyclists than cars onto any given stretch of road. And while an increase in bicyclists means taking away some existing road space to create a bike lane, these are generally half the width of a car lane. In fact, the Metro Manila Development Authority has launched a bike-sharing program in March 2014 and expanding this existing program to more major roads may magnify its transportation advantages to commuters. As a side benefit to the city as a whole, bikes are good for the health of the riders and good for the environment, since they dont rely on fossil fuels. Technology has been able to connect people who want a ride with drivers who have an available car with the use of mobile apps. Simply put, theyve found a way to optimize the use of a vehicle so that it is more widely used. Like bike-sharing, ride-sharing services can potentially take private cars off the road by providing a convenient alternate way of getting from one location to another. Can driverless vehicles play a role in easing traffic? The concept isnt as far-fetched as it might seem Consider cruise control, which is a very simple variation on a self-driving car that helps drivers maintain a set speed. Adaptive cruise control, which many cars now feature, takes this one step further by automatically adjusting the vehicle speed to maintain a safe distance from vehicles ahead. If we take this technology to an extreme, we could someday have driverless carsdrivingsix feet behind another at a steady speed of 60 miles per hourwhich would allow more cars to make use of the road than is possible today. As more and more people gravitate towards urban centers, cities will need to find new approaches to dealing with traffic congestion. By exploring the full range of available optionsrather than simply building more roadscities can effectively tackle ever-worsening traffic and make urban areas more livable places for the coming decades.",,"By Gianluca Lange, Autodesk Regional Industry Manager for AEC/ENI, ASEAN",National Economic and Development Authority NEDA Japan International Cooperation Agency JICA,yes,2014-11-08 00:00:00,reports on traffic congestion,,,,,,,,english,,http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/business/11/08/14/how-tackle-traffic-woes-without-adding-more-roads,,"cebu, metro manila, manila",text,,261.0,,1990.0,,candice,"Some stats mentioned in the report:

2014-11-10,,,"Vehicle users, Public officials, Government agencies, Civil society","Instead of having traffic aides focus almost solely on catching traffic violators, government may want to assign more of them to dangerous roads where they could assist motorists and potentially save lives.  The Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines gave this suggestion in time for the United Nations' World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims on Nov. 16.  ""There seem, especially in the Philippines, to be more enforcers on the lookout for traffic violators than those on lonely stretches of highway, mountain passes and dangerous road turns ready to render assistance to motorists in trouble!"" CBCP president and Lingayen-Dagupan Archbishop Socrates Villegas said in a posted Sunday.  He said government officials may be implicated in road accidents since many road traffic victims ""lose life or limb because of ill-constructed roads and highways, the pathetic handiwork of corrupt workmanship.""  Many drivers had fallen off cliffs, ridges and road shoulders because of inadequate road signs, ill-lighted highways and the possible ""criminal absence of assistance that should come from government functionaries tasked with road safety,"" he added.    Villegas also called for responsibility, prudence and above-all charity by motorists, ""because motorists are, in fact, the biggest threat on the highways.""  He said many road-traffic victimsincluding motorists, unwary pedestrians or just unfortunate bystanderssuffer because of several causes. These include:     Villegas said the day of remembrance must be a day of ""firm resolve"" for government, motorists and pedestrians.  For government, it should be to construct safe and reliable highways, rid of the wages of corruption, and that maintenance be regular, thorough and continuous.  For motorists, it should be to drive with that charity by which Christs disciples are to be distinguished in their regard especially for other motorists and for pedestrians, placing on the highway only roadworthy vehicles and recognizing traffic-rules for recognition of the rights of others.

2014-11-11,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesThe Department of Transport and Communications (DOTC) on Tuesday said it will begin working with app-based transport service Uber as part of its efforts to modernize the countrys transportation options. Government welcomes tech solutions to transport problems, and fortunately, Uber also wants to work with us to make it happen, Transportation Secretary Jun Abaya said. Uber is an app that lets users electronically flag down the nearest Uber-registered vehicle for hire. Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) Chairman Winston Ginez gave suggestions on how transport regulations may be updated to allow technology startups like Uber to improve passenger experience. MMDA chair Francis Tolentino supported the DOTCs move. Uber or hybrid carpooling is a well-meaning technology-driven effort intended for public safety and convenience. Thats why people are patronizing it, he said. Tolentino noted that Ubers convenience, comfort and riding safety were qualities that drove some passengers to use it over other transportation services currently available. The announcement comes as an abrupt about-face in policy, as Uber previously had difficult relations with the LTFRB. On October 22, one of Ubers partner vehicles was apprehended in a sting operation conducted by the LTFRB. The LTFRB responded to a complaint lodged by the Philippine National Taxi Operators Association (PNTOA), saying that Uber was a colorum outfit and did not have a franchise to operate vehicles for public use. LTFRBs newfound willingness to work with Uber may signal the governments commitment to easing traffic and improving the commuter experience by utilizing IT solutions. The LTFRB has pledged to draw up an updated set of provisions to accommodate more modern solutions to traffic such as Uber. Both Uber and LTFRB have said that ensuring passenger security remains their top priority.

2014-11-12,,,,"Mikka Garcia wrote to say she also did not understand why bus owners/operators oppose the high penalties for colorum and out-of-way public utility vehicles (PUV). Reacting to an earlier column on the vehement opposition to higher penalties for traffic violations, Garcia said she was surprised by the protests since the higher fines were meant to get unauthorized buses and other means of public transport off the streets to ease traffic congestion. She asked, Why are they (PUV operators) affected? Does this mean these bus companies also operate colorum and out-of-way buses, aside from duly registered vehicles? Isla LPG Corp., distributor of Solane liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), has launched a very timely campaign. It is conducting information and education sessions in communities on the proper storage and handling of LPG at home, what to do during an emergency, where to buy genuine products and how to spot illegal tanks. The Sugod Barangay campaign also allows community members to buy genuine Solane LPG. The campaign is timely as a lot of cooking will be done in households during the coming holidays. Although LPG has become a necessity in many Filipino homes, many people still do not know how to use it properly to prevent accidental fires. Teaching people what to do when and if a fire breaks out will help minimize damage. Mandaluyong City has passed an ordinance prohibiting the refilling, selling or trading of tampered, dilapidated and substandard LPG cylinders. Violators face imprisonment and fines. There is also a bill pending in Congress that sets rules on the sale and distribution of LPG throughout the country. But even with official regulations and legislation, only informed consumers can ensure that LPG is used properly and safely. Informed consumers will also discourage unscrupulous LPG sellers. Communities interested in the LPG information-education campaign should coordinate with the nearest Solane dealer to see if the Sugod Barangay team can visit them. Tish Martinez-Castillo, corporate communications and public relations manager of Gandang Kalikasan Inc. (GKI), wants to clarify that GKI is not part of the low-cost housing initiative Gawad Kalinga. GKI is the parent company of Human Nature that manufactures the organic Bug Shield insect repellent. Castillo says they are tied to Gawad Kalinga only because their founders are daughters of Tony Meloto and they partner with the housing program on many projects.

2014-03-10,,,,"The controversial Manila truck ban can cost the Philippine economy as much as P320 billion and put at risk about a million manufacturing jobs without an alternative transport linkage between the economic zones in the Cavite-Laguna-Batangas-Rizal-Quezon (Calabarzon) area and the port of Manila, an economist from American banking giant Citigroup warned. In a macro research note dated March 7, Citi economist for the Philippines Jun Trinidad said the ensuing transportation bottleneck could chop at least 1 percent to as much as 5 percent off the countrys gross domestic product (GDP) mostly affecting nontechnology export commodities. This is one of the first private sector report to quantify the economic cost of Manilas truck ban, suggesting a magnitude that may later on require intervention from the national government. In peso terms, the GDP costs were estimated at a low of P61.2 billion to as high as P320 billion, which Trinidad said would dwarf the potential benefits of P30 billion in real terms from the reduced traffic envisioned by the truck ban. Manilas truck ban casts a dark shadow on exports and GDP prospects. It may be early days, but we may be counting opportunity losses if the truck ban stays without having an alternative and effective transport option that links Calabarzons economic zones with the port of Manila, Trinidad said. Calabarzon is the second most densely populated region in the country, an industrial hub and a big contributor to GDP of the Philippines, now Southeast Asias fastest-growing economy. This new policy bans eight wheelers and vehicles with a gross weight of above 4,500 kilos from plying Manilas streets between 5 a.m. and 9 p.m in an apparent bid to ease traffic as construction starts on key tollroad projects such as the roads linking the north and south Luzon expressways. There is a temporary concession to allow trucks to ply the streets between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. within the next six to eight months but this leeway is still deemed insufficient by the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (Peza) officials and ecozone locators. Local/foreign locators in the Peza zones of Calabarzon with their export-bound cargo requiring international shipping services are destined for the port of Manila. Over time, export delays that divert foreign buyers interest could jeopardize production and jobs in Calabarzon, Trinidad said. On the other hand, Trinidad said technology producers that avail themselves of airline services in shipping out their goods may be spared unlike nontech manufacturers such as those producing car parts, with their containerized shipments that exit through Manilas port. The truck ban, which highlights the limited transport access and its potentially negative impact on exports/output, attests to the infrastructure bottlenecks that can constrain strong growth prospects, Trinidad said, noting that even the Batangas City port within the Calabarzon area itself did not have the same capacity as the Manila port. This renders crucial the infrastructure spending and public-private partnership (PPP) project implementation to ease growth bottlenecks in Metro Manila and the other regions, the economist said. We sense simmering policy conflict between national government plans that want to fast-track growth, including jobs/income creation, and local government objectives with legitimate but isolated cost/benefit concerns directed at limited constituencies, Trinidad said, citing South Cotobatos $5.9-billion Tampakan copper-gold mining project that was stalled by the local governments decision to ban open pit mining contrary to the national mining law. As such, he said state intervention may be needed if Manilas truck ban results in transport bottlenecks and export delays. In estimating the economic impact of the truck ban, the Citi economist assumed the following: nontech manufacturing such as metal components, garments, will be affected since these require containerized shipments that need to be exported via the port of Manila but with the truck ban exemptions, raw and processed food and other agro-based exports would be spared; real exports of garments and accessories, refined copper products, ignition wiring sets, metal components and basket works as a share to GDP comprise the basis for the low percentage of GDP (1 percent) likely affected by the truck ban ordinance. To this average real export ratio (2011-13), Citi took a 42 percent share, which is the percentage of manufacturing output coming out of Calabarzon relative to national manufacturing GDP and also assumed that 80 percent of Calabarzons manufactured output was for exports; In estimating the larger 5 percent share of GDP likely threatened by the ban, Citi expanded the real value of the export commodities to include other non-tech exports. It obtained the three-year average ratio of the larger set of nonelectronic exports to GDP and applied the same percentages to focus on those produced in the Peza zones of Calabarzon; The estimated one-million jobs threatened by the truck ban assumes that Calabarzons manufacturing segment contributes 34 percent to the countrys total manufacturing employment of 3.1 million, and Citi quantified the P30-billion potential relief from a reduction in traffic based on a daily traffic congestion cost of P2.4 billion as estimated by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (Jica) in an earlier study.",Doris C.

2014-11-27,,,Vehicle users,"MANILA, Philippines  The driver of a luxury sports car reportedly mauled and dragged a traffic enforcer of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) for taking a picture of him making an illegal turn in Quezon City on Thursday morning. In an interview with Radyo Inquirer 990 AM, enforcer Jorby Adriatico described the driver as in his 30s who drove a blue car that did not have any license plates. A fellow traffic enforcer of Adriatico caught the incident on video. Based on the video, Quezon City traffic officers, who investigated the case, later identified the suspects car as a Marshall Maserati, a luxury sports car. A check at showed that a lower priced Maserati, a Ghibli, averaged $67,000 (P3 million), while the more expensive one, a 2015 GranTurismo cost around $150,000 (P6.7 million) According to Adriatico, the car drove up from G. Araneta Avenue from the direction of Talayan Village and tried to make a left turn on Quezon Avenue, which was not allowed. However, Adriatico said, the Maserati still made a left. Motorists werent allowed to take a left turn on the Araneta intersection so I tried to take a picture of him as he turned left, Adriatico said. When he saw me taking a photo, he made a U-turn and drove back to where I was standing, he added. Adriatico said the driver, who was accompanied by a man also in his 30s, gave him the dirty finger and snatched his cellphone. From inside the car, the driver then grabbed Adriatico by the neck, punched him and sped off toward Edsa, with the traffic enforcer getting dragged beside the car. The enforcer said he was forced to run alongside the sports car which ran between 30 to 40 kph. When they reached the corner of Quezon Avenue and Scout Chuatoco, the driver dumped the traffic enforcer on the road before speeding off with his cellphone. Adriatico sustained a fracture on the nose. Authorities are trying to identify the owner of the car.

2014-03-13,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesGerman firms operating in the country have joined repeated calls for Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada to lift the truck ban in key routes in the city, stressing that this regretful policy would only cripple the countrys booming economy. The German-Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GPCCI) explained in a statement that while the truck ban could provide immediate relief to motorists and residents, it would eventually result in job losses not only to truck drivers but to employees of companies adversely affected by the ban. GPCCI general manager Nadine Fund quoted a member-firm of the group as saying that the truck ban would only impact negatively for the commerce and industry of Metro Manila, nearby cities, provinces and the country as a whole due to the regulated movement of goods and services. The truck ban policy, which was implemented starting last month, has reportedly been causing delays in deliveries, resulting in losses to manufacturers and retailers. Delivery of goods intended for the international market has likewise been delayed, thus affecting the countrys export revenues. The new policy in Manila bans eight wheelers and vehicles with a gross weight of above 4,500 kilos from plying Manilas streets between 5 a.m. and 9 p.m. A temporary concession was offered by the city government allowing trucks to ply streets between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. during the next six to eight months. GPCCI further warned that such a scenario could lead companies to slow down as a result of lost hours in delivery time as well as unmet business commitments and activities, eventually leading to a shutdown of their shops and job losses. Fund added that security costs would also increase with additional safety measures required to secure delivery and checking for possible pilferage. Majority of the German investments are in trading, air and sea freight, cargo forwarding, pharmaceuticals, automotive, engineering and manufacturing equipment as well as textiles and clothing, thus making German firms one of the groups most affected by the truck ban. The city government should conduct a thorough study on how to ease the traffic in the city without disrupting businesses, she pointed out. Fund said they had written letters of appeal to the city government to reconsider the truck ban and to put forward proposals to help ease the traffic situation without causing much injury to local businesses. One of the short-term solutions, according to GPCCI, would be the removal of illegally parked vehicles along major routes of delivery trucks and implementing efficient rules on parking.

On Thursday afternoon, MMDA constable Jorby Adriatico identified his assailant based on a photo, radio dzBB's James Agustin reported.  Based on Adriatico's lead, police are now verifying the involvement of one Joseph Russell Ingco, supposedly a resident of New Manila, in the assault.     Adriatico pointed to a photo of Ingco when he met with Quezon City police chief Senior Superintendent Joel Pagdilao.  Earlier Thursday, Adriatico flagged down a motorist aboard a blue Maserati at the corner of Quezon and Araneta Avenues.  The motorist made a U-turn, yanked Adriatico by the uniform, from Araneta Avenue to Scout Chuatoco.

2014-11-28,,,,"There are only a handful of motorists in the country who could be driving a Maserati, and one of them is the man who broke Jorbe Adriaticos nose. Adriatico on Thursday became the latest traffic constable of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) to figure in a high-profile road rage incident, his case made more prominent by the pricey vehicle of the alleged aggressor. Just hours after Adriatico filed a complaint, the Quezon City Police District (QCPD) tagged Joseph Russel Abacan Ingco, 39, as the driver of the blue Maserati who was encountered by the MMDA enforcer around 6:30 a.m. along Quezon Avenue. QCPD director Senior Supt. Joel Pagdilao said Adriatico, when shown a picture of Ingco that was provided by the Land Transportation Office (LTO), positively identified the man as his attacker. Ingco is recorded in the LTO as a resident of New Manila, Quezon City, the official said. Owing to the cars rarity on Philippine roads, the QCPD didnt have a long list to consider in its search for the suspect. Pagdilao said that based on information obtained from Wellington Soong, president of the company distributing Maserati cars in the country, only six of the Italian sports car had been sold locallyand only two are blue. Pagdilao said the number does not include Maseratis that may have been sold in the so-called gray market. Speaking to reporters, Adriatico vowed to press criminal charges against Ingco for serious physical injuries, grave threats and assault on a person of authority. Arriving at the QCPD Galas station with a broken nose and bloodstains on his uniform, the 39-year-old Adriatico said he was manning his post on Quezon Avenue when he saw a blue Maseratiwhich had only a conduction stickeras it was about to make an illegal left turn to Araneta Avenue. The MMDA constable said he approached to stop the mestizo-looking driver but the latter ignored him. This prompted Adriatico to take a video of the car using his mobile phone. He saw me taking a video, so instead of completing the left turn he went straight to the U-turn slot a few meters away, then stopped at the spot where I was standing, Adriatico said in a separate interview with the Inquirer. When the driver gave him the dirty finger, he said, he dared him to do it againthis time for the camera. He then snatched my phone, threw it into his car and then grabbed me by the collar, he recalled. The driver stepped on the accelerator and dragged him for several meters, punching him thrice in the face before letting him go. During the assault, the driver repeatedly threatened to kill him. I did not fight back because I was afraid he would have me sandwiched between his car and the others that were on the road, Adriatico said. The complainant recalled that the driver had a male passenger in the front seat who tried to pacify the motorist. Hours before the QCPD came up with the suspects identity, MMDA Chair Francis Tolentino offered a P100,000 reward for information leading to the drivers arrest. Tolentino, who vowed to file charges against the driver, noted that Adriatico was the latest on the growing list of MMDA personnel attacked by traffic violators. He cited the earlier case of Geraldo Santiago, who was hit with a crash helmet by a motorcycle rider whom he flagged down in Quezon City last week. Last month, two traffic enforcers were also assaulted on Edsa near Robinsons Galleria mall allegedly by a drunk lawyer driving a black BMW sedan.

2014-11-28,,,,"  Criminal complaints were lodged Friday against a Maserati-driving motorist who assaulted a Metropolitan Manila Development Authority constable in Quezon City Thursday morning.  The complaints against Joseph Russel Ingco stemmed from Thursday's incident that injured MMDA constable Jerbe Adriatico, radio dzBB's James Agustin reported Friday.  Ingco, 39, now faces charges of serious physical injuries, grave threats, direct assault on a person in authority, and robbery.  A referral letter by the Quezon City police's Criminal Investigation and Detection Unit to the city prosecutor showed the incident occurred at 6:30 a.m. Thursday, when Adriatico and buddy Rodolfo Fernandez were conducting traffic enforcement at Araneta corner Quezon Avenues.  They spotted a blue Maserati driven by Ingco about to make an illegal left turn, and Adriatico took a photo of the act.  But Ingco, apparently noticing Adriatico taking a photo, made a U-turn and then flashed a dirty finger at Adriatico.  When Adriatico approached Ingco and asked him to repeat the dirty finger gesture, Ingco allegedly grabbed Adriatico's mobile phone and his uniform.  He then dragged the MMDA enforcer while his sports car was moving. Adriatico was dragged from Araneta Avenue to Chuatoco Street - which Adriatico said was about 500 meters.  At Chuatoco corner Panay Streets, Ingco allegedly threatened Adriatico by uttering: ""P..... i.. mo, papatayin kita,"" before speeding away.    Meanwhile, the QCPD assured the family of Adriatico of protection following Thursday's incident, dzBB's James Agustin reported.    Adriatico's family had voiced fears for security.

2014-04-06,,,,"MANILA, Philippines  Local and foreign business groups have warned anew of a more serious economic damage that the expanded truck ban policy may cause when the volume of trucks coming in and out of the port of Manila picks up in the next two months. The situation will require better and more inclusive solutions that will ensure a more efficient use of the Manila port and better utilization of those in Batangas and Subic, according to the Joint Foreign Chambers and the Semiconductor and Electronics Industries of the Philippines Inc. in a joint statement on Sunday. We are aware that individual stakeholders discuss solutions with individual affected parties at the moment, but the fact remains that only an inclusive stakeholders roundtable can assess the magnitude and the complexity of the issue and develop short, mid-term, and long-term solutions for the Manila port and the usage of the ports of Batangas and Subic, the groups explained in the statement. The business community is of the opinion that such roundtable should be headed by the national government, preferably a senior Cabinet member, to drive the search for solutions and see to it that those are implemented. In our opinion that inclusive roundtable should take place now, before the trade volume picks up in a month or two, which will aggravate the logistics situation, they further stressed. Stakeholders that should be invited in the dialogue include the port operators; shipping lines; truckers; local government units of Manila, Caloocan, and Paraaque; Department of Public Works and Highways; Department of Transportation and Communication; Metro Manila Development Authority; National Housing Authority; Philippine Ports Authority; Philippine Economic Zone Authority; Bureau of Customs; and foreign and local chambers. Based on discussions we have had with some stakeholders, we firmly believe that a steady, well-managed flow of trucks with an effective appointment system will create less traffic disruption, will allow a more effective use of the port facilities and will maintain related cost at a reasonable level flow of imports and exports going, the groups added. The truck ban policy being implemented in the City of Manila bans eight wheelers and vehicles with a gross weight of above 4,500 kilos from plying Manilas streets between 5 a.m. and 9 p.m. A temporary concession was offered by the city government allowing trucks to ply streets between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. during the next six months. This truck ban prompted trucking firms to hike their respective hauling charges by an average of 50 percent, a move that may redound to higher cost of goods for the end-consumers. Trucking firms, however, are now being probed by the Department of Trade and Industry on this move, for possible collusion and anti-competitive practices. Other business groups such as the European Chamber of Commerce in the Philippines, the Federation of Philippines Industries (FPI), and the German-Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GPCCI) have since warned the government that the expanded daytime truck ban would only cripple businesses and likely result in a cut in the growth of exports and production, job losses and potential company closures. The ECCP has put forward seven solutions to address the logistics problem at the Manila port, including the elimination of an all truck-delivery bans completely and the formulation of a proper, coordinated, and efficient 24-hour truck route regulation system; removal of empty containers from the port are; and extension of the working hours of Customs to 24/7, among others.

2014-05-08,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesA week after paralyzing their Manila port operations, businessmen protesting the citys expanded daytime truck ban are counting on a big client and one of the countrys richest men to help them convince former President and now Mayor Joseph Estrada to change his mind about the traffic scheme. We are waiting for Lucio Tan to call us for a meeting, said Mary Zapata, president of the Aduana Business Club Inc. (ABCI), which staged what it called a stakeholders holiday at the Manila International Container Terminal (MICT). Zapata said a meeting held Tuesday between Estrada and an emissary of Tan from the Federation of Filipino-Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry Inc. (FCCCII), which is helping the ABCI on the issue, produced no breakthroughs. Tan is the president emeritus of FCCCII. The tycoon, whose business empire includes interests in the airline, banking, tobacco and real estate industries, supported Estrada in his rise to the presidency, but the two men had a falling-out in the years leading to Estradas ouster in 2001. According to Zapata, Tan is our (trucking) client and he has a lot of cargoes being held up in the port. ABCI and other trucking groups maintain that the two-month-old traffic scheme has been hurting their operations and those of the companies they serve. They have since staged strikes calling on the national government to intervene. As of Monday, MICT has reached 99-percent yard utilization, meaning the holding area was nearing full capacity, according to Reynaldo Soliman, executive vice president of the Professional Customs Brokers Association of the Philippines. At least 11 vessels had been prevented from unloading and forced to wait outside the breakwater, Soliman said, quoting an update from the Association of International Shipping Lines. Asked about the meeting with Tans emissary from FCCCII, Estrada said: Were still studying it. We have to balance things. (The ban) may have affected them but it has also benefited so many peoplestudents, teachers, employees. As to the situation at the Manila port, I think the national government should do something about it, Estrada said. We have the Batangas and Subic ports, they have spent money on it. The national government should direct (cargo haulers) to use these ports. In a statement, Manila Vice Mayor Francisco Isko Moreno Domagoso said the City Hall had already acceded to most, if not all (the truckers) requests, like when it allowed window hours from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. They are the ones who should be held liable for economic sabotage, Domagoso said.

2014-05-11,,,,"MANILA, Philippines  The Bureau of Customs has extended its operating hours at the Port of Manila (POM) and the Manila International Container Port (MICP) to address the adverse effects of the Manila city governments expanded truck ban on the revenue collection efforts of the Department of Finance-attached agency. BOC collections at the POM and the MICP, two of the countrys biggest ports, are reportedly down by P100 million to P150 million a day due to the truck ban, which has been imposed by Manila City Hall since Feb. 24. Customs Commissioner John Phillip Sevilla has issued a directive authorizing BOC personnel at the POM and the MICPto render overtime services seven days a week and even on public holidays when necessary. In Customs Memorandum Order No. 09-2014, dated May 8, he said the bureaus X-ray units and the Management and Information System Technology Group will also be directly involved in the needed extended operating hours. However, the BOC head clarified overtime services with pay shall be allowed only for incumbents of plantilla positions of division chiefs and below, as well as casual employees. Overtime services shall include those rendered beyond eight hours of work on a regular work day (Monday to Friday), those rendered on rest days (Saturday and Sunday) and those rendered on public holidays, he explained. According to Sevilla payment of overtime services shall be charged against savings of the Bureau of Customs, which may be determined at the end of every quarter by the Budget Division. The revised truck ban has also resulted in longer working hours for employees of the state-run Land Bank of the Philippines and the Development Bank of the Philippines. The move was aimed to facilitate transactions with importers and exporters and receive payment for Customs duties and other fees, said LBP and DBP officials. In a statement, the BOC said private businesses, as well as the governments revenue collections, have been hurt by the truck ban. It noted that on the first day of the ban on Feb. 24 alone, the release of container vans of imported goods from the MICP fell from an average of 2,190 per day to just four. At the POM, it dropped from an average of 1,200 daily to zero. Initially, trucks and other vehicles with gross weight of at least 4,500 kilograms were not allowed in the streets of Manila from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. A temporary concession was offered by the city government allowing trucks to ply city streets between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. during the next six months. This is seven hours longer than the previous scheme. There is no truck ban on Saturdays and Sundays. Exempted from the ban are trucks carrying perishable and petroleum product, as well as vehicles carrying materials intended for government projects. The truck ban prompted trucking firms to hike their hauling charges by an average of 50 percent, a move that may lead to an increase in the prices of goods for consumers. Last week, the Aduana Business Club, one of the groups protesting the expanded truck ban, sought the help of tycoon Lucio Tan in convincing Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada to change his mind about the traffic scheme. Tan, the president emeritus of the Federation of Filipino-Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry and whose business empire includes interests in the airline, banking, tobacco and real estate industries, backed Estrada in his rise to the presidency. Last May 6, an unnamed emissary of Tan reportedly met with Estrada, who later told reporters they were still studying the issueWe have to balance things. Asked about the situation at Manilas Port Area, the former president said, I think the national government should do something about it. Other business groups, such as the European Chamber of Commerce in the Philippines and the Federation of Philippine Industries, have warned that the expanded truck ban would cripple, if not result in closure of some businesses and job losses, and likely cut the growth in production and export of goods.

The traffic constable said he took a video of the Maserati, prompting the driver to go straight on Araneta Avenue and make a u-tur The Maserati driver then gave Adriatico the dirty finger, angering the MMDA employee who then challenged the driver to do it again. It was then that the driver grabbed Adriatico's phone and his collar and dragged him along while the car was moving along Quezon Avenue. Adriatico said Ingco punched him twice in the face, breaking his nose, even as he ran beside the car. He said the driver only let him go when his passenger noticed that another traffic enforcer was following them on a motorcycle. MMDA Chairman Francis Tolentino also said they expect more details on Ingco to come out today. They also want to cancel his driver's license.",,ABS-CBNnews.com,,yes,2014-11-28 00:00:00,"enforcement of existing lawsordinances,road rage",,,,,,,,english,,http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/11/28/14/maserati-used-mmda-enforcer-attack-found,,"valencia, quezon city, quezon, manila",text,#maserati,750.0,,1855.0,,pia,,,traffic enforcement and violations,4.5,-,,,,,,abs-cbnnews,yes,,,,,Maserati used in MMDA enforcer attack found,Neutral,,
2014-05-13,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesIn preparation for the 23rd World Economic Forum to be hosted by the country from May 21 to 23, Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada agreed on Monday to lift for eight days the modified truck ban being implemented by the city government. Through Executive Order No. 49, Estrada approved the request of Public Works Secretary Rogelio Singson and Cabinet Secretary Jose Rene Almendras for a moratorium on the expanded truck ban starting Tuesday up to May 20. The eight-day break was expected to give the national government enough time to decongest the Port of Manila before the international forum, clearing it of the huge number of container vans that had accumulated as a result of the truck ban. In February, Estrada enforced City Ordinance No. 8336 which banned eight-wheeler trucks with a gross vehicle weight of at least 4,500 kilograms from plying Manilas roads from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. Negotiations prompted by a truck holiday led to the granting of a window period between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. upon the intervention of business organizations, truck operators and national government officials. With the lifting of the modified truck ban, truckers should follow for the next eight days the one being implemented by the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA). Under the MMDA policy, truckers cannot ply their routes from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. and between 5 p.m. and 10 p.m. every day, except on Sundays and holidays. In a letter to Estrada on Friday, Singson noted that because of the container backlog at the port, some international vessels have been bypassing the Port of Manila because of the long queuing of six to seven vessels at any given time. At a press conference on Monday at the new command center of the Manila City Hall, Estrada said that he found Singsons request compelling enough to grant a moratorium. He also noted that the international forum was important for the whole country as it would benefit the economy. However, Estrada stressed that trucks would still not be allowed to park between A. Bonifacio Street to Del Pan Bridge and any road or street designated as no parking areas by the Manila Traffic and Parking Bureau (MTPB). All container trucks would also be allowed to enter and leave the Port of Manila during both the modified and regular truck operating hours provided that they stick to designated truck routes, he added. In the route plan submitted by the Department of Public Works and Highways to the city government, trucks coming from the North Luzon Expressway would have to take Balintawak to A. Bonifacio, turn right on C-3 then turn left on Road 10. Vehicles coming from the port and going to NLEX should take Bonifacio Drive, turn right on C-3 then turn right again on A. Bonifacio. From Cavite and the South Luzon Expressway (SLEX), truckers are advised to turn right on President Quirino Avenue, turn left on Plaza Dilao/Pres. Quirino Avenue Extension, turn left on United Nations Avenue, right on Romualdez then turn left on Ayala Boulevard. From there, all trucks are advised to turn right on A. Bonifacio Drive. For trucks coming from the port and going to SLEX and Cavite, they should take A. Bonifacio, turn left on P. Burgos, then turn right on San Marcelino. From there, they should turn left on United Nations Avenue, right on Plaza Dilao, right on Pres. Quirino Avenue Extension then left on Osmea Highway. Another condition of the moratorium, according to Estrada, is that container trucks inside the port would be allowed to exit during the truck ban hours provided that they be regulated and dispatched by port operators at a rate not to exceed 200 trucks per hour. These trucks are also advised to use only the designated routes to the north, south and Cavite province. The port operators also offered to collect and pay the city a P100 dispatch fee per truck or P180,000 per day, whichever is higher, Estrada said, adding that the amount would be remitted daily to the city treasurer as donation. He explained that the money would be used for traffic enforcement activities and the truck routes may be modified by the city government if necessary. RELATED STORIES",Maricar B.

2014-05-19,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesBureau of Customs (BOC) personnel welcomed the Manila city governments eight-day moratorium on its modified truck ban in preparation for the 23rd World Economic Forum (WEF) which the country is hosting this week. However, a top official of the Department of Finance-attached agency dismissed the lifting of the truck ban as just temporary relief. The official, who asked not to be named for lack of authority to speak on the matter, pointed out that BOC collections at the Port of Manila (POM) and the Manila International Container Port (MICP) were down by P100 million to P150 million per day due to the truck ban, which was imposed by Manila City Hall on Feb. 24. Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada last week approved the request of Public Works Secretary Rogelio Singson for a moratorium on the ban through Executive Order No. 49. Under a Manila City ordinance, trucks with a gross vehicle weight of at least 4,500 kilograms are banned from plying the capitals roads from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. Negotiations prompted by a truck holiday led to the granting of a window between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. upon the intervention of business groups, truck operators and some government officials. With the lifting of the modified truck ban, truckers are required to follow the policy implemented by the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority, which prohibits truckers from plying their routes from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. and between 5 p.m. and 10 p.m. every day, except Sundays and holidays. In a May 12 press conference, Estrada said he found Singsons request compelling enough to grant a moratorium. However, he clarified that trucks would still not be allowed to park from Andres Bonifacio Street to Del Pan Bridge in the Port Area or any thoroughfare designated as a No Parking zone by the Manila Traffic and Parking Bureau. The same customs official also expressed doubt the eight-day break would give the BOC enough time to decongest the Port Area before the international forum, scheduled from May 21 to 23, starts. Container vans of imported goods have accumulated at the POM and MICP, two of the countrys biggest ports, as a result of the truck ban. On May 8, Customs Commissioner John Phillip Sevilla issued a directive extending the agencys operating hours at the two ports to address the adverse effects of the truck ban on the bureaus revenue collections. In Customs Memorandum Order No. 09-2014, Sevilla said that aside from POM and MICP personnel, the agencys X-ray units and the Management and Information System Technology Group will also be involved in the needed extended operating hours. Last month, the POM and the MICP registered revenue shortfalls of P2.02 billion and P1.39 billion, respectively, according to a BOC report. These brought to P6.9 billion and P6.08 billion the two ports accumulated revenue deficits during the first four months of the year.",Jerry E.

2014-11-29,,,,"  A Maserati-driving businessman accused of mauling a traffic officer in the Philippine capital went on national television Friday to defend himself after he was transformed into an internet villain.  The businessman, Joseph Russel Ingco, told national evening newscasts on Friday that he felt forced to explain his side of the incident out of safety fears.  Ingco was caught on video holding a traffic officer by his shirt and dragging him along the road out of the window of his blue Maserati Ghibli. The aide had flagged him down for a violation.  The video, shot by a fellow traffic officer, went viral, drawing the ire of the country's vocal Facebook and Twitter mobs, and prompting city authorities to put up a 100,000-peso ($2,000) reward for information on the businessman's whereabouts.  Social media users vilified Ingco, calling him a ""road bully"", ""liar"" and ""mauler"".  ""This shows that social media can be a tool for justice,"" Francis Tolentino, head of a government body that manages traffic in Manila, told AFP on Saturday.  ""I am afraid for my safety. I am willing to face the consequences,"" Ingco told GMA television, stuttering at some points during the interview.  Ingco admitted to punching the traffic aide, but said it was only to loosen the officer's grip on his shirt collar. He claimed the aide punched him too, though he had no visible bruises on his face.  Ingco's victim, Jorbe Adriatico, will undergo surgery on Saturday to repair his broken nose.  ""I still couldn't sleep. The incident keeps playing in my head,"" Adriatico, with a bandaged nose, told ABS-CBN television of his Thursday morning run-in with Ingco.  Police filed an assault complaint against Ingco before city prosecutors, who will decide if he is to stand trial. No arrest warrant has been issued.  Tolentino vouched for the traffic aide's credibility, saying he had so far served an exemplary six years with the traffic bureau and was cited by police for helping arrest street criminals.  ""I think he's telling the truth. He's a credible guy and we stand by him,"" he said.  Tolentino said video of the incident ""affirms the truthfulness"" of the traffic aide's statement.  Luxury sport scars such as Maseratis are rare sights in Manila, where narrow, ill-maintained roads breed monstrous gridlock that sometimes spark incidents of road rage.  In 2002, a cigarette company executive was pilloried on Twitter and Facebook after he slapped a traffic enforcer. He was suspended from work and charged in court with direct assault.  Tolentino said he would help Adriatico pursue charges against Ingco and would oppose possible attempts at a settlement.

2014-11-29,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesThe Maserati-driving motorist who allegedly assaulted a traffic constable in Quezon City also faces a robbery complaint and is reportedly an owner of several firearms whose licenses have already expired. A check by the police also showed that Joseph Russel Ingco has 42 other vehicles registered in his name, including at least 15 trucks and three sport utility vehicles. These new legal issues and additional information about Ingco cropped up Friday, even as he sent a lawyer to meet with the chief of the Quezon City Police District (QCPD) and issued a press statement saying the truth will eventually come out. Inqco, 39, has yet to surface at the QCPD at press time. A police team failed to find him Thursday night at his known address at a condominium building in New Manila, but the team spotted his Maserati at the parking area. QCPD director Senior Supt. Joel Pagdilao said Inqco would also be sued for taking the cell phone of Jorbe Adriatico, the traffic aide from the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) who earlier filed complaints against the motorist for punching him and breaking his nose Thursday morning. It was the same cell phone used by Adriatico to take a video of Ingco in his Italian sports car, which the MMDA enforcer encountered on Quezon Avenue as it was about to make an illegal left turn. Irked by Adriaticos actions, Ingco instead made the proper U-turn through a slot several meters away but later flashed the dirty finger at him, according to the complaint. The motorist turned violent when Adriatico dared him to repeat the taunting gesture. According to Pagdilao, records from the Land Transportation Office showed that Ingco may be in the trucking business. Aside from the Maserati, he has a fleet of trucks in his name along with three SUVs, he said. Meanwhile, a police official based in Camp Crame said Ingco has records in the Firearms and Explosives Office of the Philippine National Police. The official, who declined to be named for lack of clearance to speak on the matter, said the motorist had several firearms registered with the PNP but that their licenses had already expired. Also on Friday, Ingcos lawyer Ian Ludovice met with Pagdilao to assure the QCPD chief that his client would face the complaints. In a statement sent to GMA News, Ingco said he would submit himself to the proper legal processes. I am a very private person and my wife and children are severely suffering from all the cruel statements being made against my person, Ingco said. What happened was truly sad but I hope that people will let due process take its course. I am praying for the patience and unders tanding of everybody. I have full trust and confidence in our legal system and I believe that the truth will eventually come out, he added. Adriatico still had a plaster strip on his broken nose when he spoke to reporters at the QCPD yesterday. He said his stolen cell phone could no longer be reached when he tried calling it. He said hes pressing charges against Ingco because drivers have a low regard for us, traffic enforcers, and (my experience) must not happen to the others. Told of Ingcos statement, Adriatico maintained that truth is on my side; Im not making anything up. He said he would not agree to any settlement because I want traffic enforcers to be respected on the road. According to Pagdilao, Adriatico received awards from the QCPD in May this year and in 2010 for helping the police arrest snatchers in Quezon City. We believe in his character and his desire to serve the public, he said. RELATED STORIES ",Jaymee T.

2014-11-30,,,,"MANILA - Joseph Russel Ingco, the driver of the blue Maserati Ghibli sports car who allegedly roughed up traffic enforcer Jurve Adriatico, will file counter charges belying the road rage incident in Quezon City last Tuesday. In a statement released by his lawyer yesterday, Ingco said he will no longer report to the police for investigation and instead will file countercharges against Adriatico. The Quezon City Police District (QCPD) on Friday filed a complaint of serious physical injuries, assault on person of authority and robbery against Ingco. Lawyer Edgardo Padernal said Ingco did not go to the police because he felt the investigators have already prejudged him. Instead, Ingco will answer all the allegations of Adriatico against him by filing countercharges of grave threats, physical injuries, libel and a civil suit for damages, according to Padernal. QCPD director Senior Superintendent Joel Pagdilao, however, belied Ingcos claims. He said they never prejudged Ingco and he should have aired his side when the investigation of the incident was ongoing. In a statement, Ingco claimed Adriatico attacked him for no apparent reason and he only acted in self-defense. Ingco maintained he did not violate any traffic rule, which is why he confronted Adriatico when he saw him taking a video on a cellphone. According to Ingco, he shoved the cellphone but then Adriatico struck him in the face. He added Adriatico was holding onto his left arm while he was trying to free himself. Ingco admitted striking Adriatico in the face while trying to free himself from his grip and drove off, dragging the traffic enforcer. I did not make an illegal left turn. I made a legal u-turn, Ingco said in a statement. During the confrontation, Adriatico asked Ingco: Ano problema mo? (Whats the problem) to which Ingco replied: Is there a problem? I did not make the left turn, why is it you are taking a video of me? Ingco claimed Adriatico was stopping him and shouting at him. I think he was arrogant and abusive but he was not asking for my license. He taunted me with his cellphone in my face. And so I hit his cellphone and it fell. He got angry and hit me in the face, Ingco said. Ingco claimed Adriatico grabbed and wrestled with his arm. Adriatico allegedly scratched his arm while pulling his shirt. So I drive off slowly to escape from him. He did not want to let go of me. He kept on pulling on my shirt to get me out of the car. I drove off again but slowly so he will let go. If I wanted to hurt him, I would have driven very fast until he will fall. He did not let go of my arms so I tried to hit him only to escape. Then my shirt came off and I finally drove off, Ingco said. According to Ingco, he has no history or record of violence in his life. I am a peaceful person and my family was deeply hurt, especially my children, after reading all the TV and social media news, he said. Ingco was caught on video holding a traffic officer by his shirt and dragging him along the road out of the window of his blue Maserati Ghibli. The aide had flagged him down for a violation. The video, shot by a fellow traffic officer, went viral, drawing the ire of the countrys vocal Facebook and Twitter mobs, and prompting city authorities to put up a P100,000 reward for information on the businessmans whereabouts. Social media users vilified Ingco, calling him a road bully, liar and mauler. This shows that social media can be a tool for justice, said Francis Tolentino, chairman of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) that employed Adriatico as a traffic enforcer. I am afraid for my safety. I am willing to face the consequences, Ingco told GMA television, stuttering at some points during the interview. Tolentino, however, doubted Ingcos statements that it was Adriatico who first struck and threatened to kill him. There is the element of spontaneity. Adriaticos statements was more spontaneous, which means it was not rehearsed, he said. Tolentino expressed dismay that Ingco is now claiming he was the victim of alleged harassment and that he will also be filing charges against Adriatico. Tolentino noted Ingco went into hiding after the incident and may have rehearsed his alibi. He added several people witnessed the incident. He said Ingco, who was driving a sports car, could have just pushed a button to close the cars window to prevent the traffic enforcer from attacking him. The MMDA said Ingco made an illegal turn and when he noticed that he was being photographed and his video was being taken, he made a u-turn. Tolentino vouched for Adriaticos credibility, saying he had so far served an exemplary six years with the MMDA and was cited by police for helping arrest street criminals. I think hes telling the truth. Hes a credible guy and we stand by him, he said. Tolentino said video of the incident affirms the truthfulness of the traffic aides statement. He also challenged Ingco to take a lie detector test if he is telling the truth. Tolentino said he would help Adriatico pursue charges against Ingco and would oppose possible attempts at a settlement. Lets move towards justice, he said. Tolentino said Adriatico, who has undergone surgery for a broken nose yesterday, is moving from one place to another for fear of his life. I still couldnt sleep.

MANILA - Malacanang called on the public to immediately submit themselves to investigations if they indeed feel aggravated by traffic enforcement rules, saying there is no justification for road rages. In an interview with radio dzRB, Communications Secretary Herminio Coloma, Jr. said: The traffic constables of the [Metropolitan Manila Development Authority] are enforcers of the law and they make sure traffic rules are followed. There is no rationale for road rages. Coloma was reacting to the incident involving Joseph Russel Ingco, the driver of the blue Maserati Ghibli, who allegedly bullied and roughed up traffic enforcer Jorbe Adriatico during an altercation in Quezon City last week. Ingco said he will no longer submit himself to a police probe, noting that he was already judged for his actions. He claimed self-defense when he supposedly dragged Adriatico a hundred meters down the road. MMDA chief Francis Tolentino is standing by Adriatico, saying his accounts were spontaneous whereas Ingco only appeared a few days after to give his side of the story.

2014-12-01,,,,"MANILA - Another motorist has complained of the alleged abusive behavior of traffic constable Jorbe Adriatico last month. MMDA Chairman Francis Tolentino, however, said it was the female motorist who cursed Adriatico and said the incident has nothing to do with Adriatico's mauling by a Maserati driver. Adriatico earlier accused Maserati driver Joseph Russel Ingco of grabbing his cellphone, punching him and beside his vehicle after he allegedly took a video of Ingco last week. Ingco, however, told TV Patrol that it was the traffic enforcer who slapped him, and threatened to kill him. ""Actually, dinuduraan pa niya ako e,"" Ingco told TV Patrol. In an interview with ABS-CBN News, law student ""Grace"" said Adriatico when she asked for the constable's assistance when she figured in a road collision along Banawe in Quezon City. Grace said she asked for Adriatico's help after another car bumped her vehicle on Banawe. Instead of helping her, Adriatico merely swore at her and spat on the ground. ""P***na, hindi ko responsibilidad yan. Letse, sabay dura siya sa harap ko,"" she said. She said Adriatico also whipped out his phone and started recording her on video. ""Gigil na gigil siya. Sobrang galit. 'Akala mo kung sino ka, o, trending ka.' Sobra akong na-violate. Lumiit yung tingin ko sa pagkababae ko,"" she said. She said Adriatico also came in conflict with a lawyer in October. Grace said she was prevailed upon by a concerned citizen not to pursue the argument with Adriatico. She also said she came out not to support Ingco but only to reveal Adriatico's behavior. ""Kung lalaki ako, mabubugbog ko rin siya...Mare-realize din ng Adriatico na dapat medyo dahan dahan din siya na hindi lahat ay pagbibigyan na lang siya,"" she said. Several people in Banawe also claimed the constable has the habit of cursing and flashing the dirty finger on people whom he runs in conflict with. Adriatico has denied the allegations, saying he never cursed Grace during the altercation. ""Hindi po ako nagmura sa kanya, siya ang nagmura sa akin. Pinalaki kami ng magulang ko sa maayos,"" he said. Adriatico is expected to ask the Land Transportation Office to revoke Ingco's license. On the other hand, MMDA Chairman Francis Tolentino said it was actually Grace who started cursing Adriatico during the traffic incident. Speaking to Mornings@ANC, the MMDA chief said Grace's complaint is meant to muddle the issue and came out only after Ingco accused Adriatico of abuse. ""These are two unrelated issues. The Banawe issue is not related to the Maserati mauling incident. The lady law student came out days after it was announced by the Ingco camp that a lady complainant would be coming out and so indeed a lady complainant came out,"" he said. ""All the things that the lady law student has narrated has nothing to do with the Maserati case. I think this is trying to confuse the issue and it will not be admitted in the rules of evidence pursuant to the rules of court,"" he added. In the ANC interview, Tolentino said Grace's car was illegally parked at Banawe Avenue and was bumped by another vehicle. He said Grace asked for Adriatico's help but the owner of the second vehicle went into a building and took some time getting out. ""Nung matagal bumaba, siya naman ang minumura ng babae kaya vinideo niya,"" he said. The MMDA chairman said Adriatico was able to settle the differences between the two car owners since Grace's car had only a minor scratch. Tolentino cautioned against looking at the second complaint as proof that Adriatico is prone to abuse. ""If you confuse everything, hahanapan mo na rin ng kaso si Mr. Ingco, which is unfair,"" he said. He said MMDA personnel are always on the receiving end of complaints. ""Lahat ng na-assign namin sa luhar na heavily occupied by street vendors, illegally parked vehicles such as Baclaran, EDSA Taft Balintawak, wala hong nakasundong tao dun kasi galit sila kapag pinaalis sa bangketa,"" he said. He also said Adriatico's alleged abusive behavior towards Grace cannot be used as evidence in the Maserati incident. Even Ingco's claim that he was verbally abused by Adriatico must be proven in court, he said. What will stand in court, he said, is Adriatico's broken nose. ""Yung Maserati event, pagmumura dapat patunayan yun. The physical evidence right now is the broken nose. Inopera e. That will stand in court,"" he said. He also challenged Ingco to identify his passenger, who was on the Maserati during the alleged mauling. Meanwhile, a third motorist has complained of allegedly committed by Adriatico, the traffic constable who was punched by a Maserati driver in Quezon City last week. In a letter read on air by DZMM anchor Ted Failon, a female motorist accused Adriatico of punching her car and shouting hurtful words at her last February 27, 2013. The letter is addressed to Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) Chairman Francis Tolentino. In her complaint, the motorist said she was trying to make a U-turn on Quezon Avenue corner Roces when she was cut off by a jeepney at around 1:15 p.m. on February 27, 2013. This forced her to transfer to the outer lane before the U-turn slot. The motorist said she noticed an MMDA enforcer on Quezon Avenue, prompting her to honk her horn to ask for assistance. Instead of helping her, the enforcer allegedly punched her car out of anger. The motorist said she got out of her car to ask what was wrong but the enforcer, identified as Adriatico, started staying hurtful words. In the letter, the motorist said Adriatico's superior, identified only as a certain MMDA enforcer Braganza, witnessed the incident and told the constable to apologize. Instead of apologizing, Adriatico allegedly took her picture and continued to threaten her. She said Braganza apologized for Adriatico's behavior and said he would report the constable's insubordination. The motorist said she was surprised to see that her car was damaged because of Adriatico's punch. She said she called the MMDA Chairman's office to complain and was informed that to file a formal complaint in writing. The MMDA has yet to issue a statement on the motorist's complaint.",,ABS-CBNnews.com,Metropolitan Manila Development Authority,yes,2014-12-01 00:00:00,enforcement of existing lawsordinances,,,,,,,,english,,http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/12/01/14/second-motorist-complains-abuse-tolentino-defends-constable,,"quezon city, quezon, manila",text,#maserati,35.0,,1552.0,,mavie,"This is part of an ongoing story about the altercation between Maserati driver, Joseph Russel Ingco and MMDA traffic enforcer, Jorbe Adriatico.

2014-07-04,,,,"President Aquino should order the lifting of the truck ban in the City of Manila, which has contributed to the recent rise in consumer prices and has made it more expensive for businesses to operate in the country. According to one of the countrys top economists, Manilas truck ban, ordered by former President and city Mayor Joseph Ejercito Estrada, has failed to achieve its desired effects. Revoke the ban because its just creating traffic in other places and goods arent getting delivered, University of Asia & the Pacific economist Victor Abola said. Speaking during the First Metro Investment Corp.s mid-year economic briefing, Abola said Malacaang should step in and force Manilas local government to lift the truck ban, given the repercussions on the broader economy. Its just throwing everything into chaos, Abola said. A study by Citigroup last March showed that losses due to the truck ban could reach as much as P320 billion, or the equivalent of 5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). This dwarfs the potential benefits of P30 billion in real terms from the reduced traffic arising from the truck ban. This new policy bans eight-wheelers and vehicles with a gross weight of above 4,500 kilos from plying Manilas streets between 5 a.m. and 9 p.m. in an apparent bid to ease traffic as construction starts on key projects such as the roads linking the North and South Luzon expressways. There is a temporary concession to allow trucks to ply the streets between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. Abola said recent reports from importers painted a grim picture. Before the truck ban, it used to take an average of two to three days to unload goods from ships at Manilas ports. Now its up to two to four weeks to get their goods brought down to the port, Abola said. He said these delays have contributed to the tight supply of food in the country, which has pushed average consumer prices up. Nine analysts polled by the Inquirer this week said inflation could reach at least 4.6 percent in June, accelerating from 4.5 percent in May. If the projections were correct, inflation would be at its highest in two and a half years. Paolo G.

2014-12-01,,,,"Traffic jams are getting worse every day in Metro Manila and environs. This situation is exacerbated by stupid planning and the lack of coordination among government agencies in charge of transportation and traffic enforcement and concerned local government units. Last Saturday, friends and I had a birthday lunch in Chinatown. We left a press forum at Annabels in Quezon City in two cars at 12 noon. We had the birthday lunch in just a little over an hour, but we didnt get home until 7 p.m. The reason: traffic jams all over Metro Manila. We took Quezon Avenue, Espaa, Quiapo, and up Quezon Bridge. At the foot of the bridge at Plaza Bonifacio, we turned right to the tunnel under Sta. Cruz Bridge, planning to come out at the service road between the Post Office and the Postal Savings Bank to turn right at Jones Bridge and then to Chinatown. In the tunnel, however, debris was scattered across the road. The street was being repaired but there was no worker in sight. It was as if the road repair job had been abandoned. There was no sign that the road was closed to traffic. The site is just five minutes from the head office of the Department of Public Works and Highways in the Port Area. We turned back, went through Intramuros and came out of the Walled City near the office of the Bureau of Immigration beside the Pasig River. We were planning to use the road beside the river to reach the foot of Jones Bridge. But that road was also closed. We turned back again, went past City Hall and the National Museum and around the rotunda to reach the flyover to Jones Bridge, but the traffic there was hardly moving. We moved by inches, literally. It took us more than an hour to get to Jones Bridge. At its foot is the welcome arch to Chinatown. But there was no welcome; that part of the road was also closed. We had to go around a few blocks to get to the street just after the arch. The street under the arch had been cemented over. The part was no more than 10 or 15 square meters long, but it held up traffic for nearly a kilometer. Past the Binondo Church, Chinatown traffic is always congested. In spite of the fact that the streets are narrow, double parking is allowed. Again, we had to literally crawl forward. The lunch host and guide, Inquirer food columnist and Manila Hotel crooner Margaux Salcedo, who came from Makati, texted that she also had to crawl through traffic to get to our restaurant. When we found parking places, we left the cars and walked the rest of the way to the Hole in the Wall where we had a quick Chinese lunch. Then we started to walk back to the cars, but a downpour prevented some of us from even crossing the street. We waited it out in another restaurant. Finally, we were in the cars and got out of Chinatown at Plaza Sta. Cruz and across the bridge, past City Hall, the National Museum and around the rotunda again, across the bridge to Mendiola, turned right toward Malacaang, then to Sta. Mesa and Quezon City. At Quezon Avenue, the Elliptical Road, Commonwealth Avenue and all connecting streets, traffic was crawling again. These are very wide streets. Commonwealth is the widest in the Philippines and traffic there was never that heavy except when the Iglesia ni Cristo held one of its birthday bashes. The reason this time: The Quezon City government was holding a marathon in the streets after an only-one-day notice. A marathon on city streets during the evening rush hours, on a Saturday after payday, at the same time that malls were having their Christmas sales? Isnt that stupid? We made shortcuts through two private subdivisions and came out on Congressional Avenue where we found the traffic also hardly moving. The reason: those infernal road reblocking projectsagain. Huge cement mixers, giant cranes, and jackhammers were blocking two lanes of the avenue; only one lane was left for the long line of vehicles that included huge cargo trucks and trailers. There were no sign of workers on the job. It seemed all the road workers had taken a holiday. That trip to Chinatown took us seven hours, the same time it takes to drive from Quezon City to Baguio and back. What I and many other motorists cannot understand is this: Congressional Avenue Extension is a relatively new street, but it has already been repaired several times, although there wasnt anything wrong with it. Private contractors would just arrive with jackhammers and tear up perfectly good streets, then pour new concrete into the holes. This is also happening in many other streets. Isnt that a waste of the peoples money just to make some contractors so happy that they would be willing to share some of their profits? In the meantime, many other streets in the provinces are not being repaired allegedly for lack of funds. Another puzzler: Cant the DPWH, the Metro Manila Development Authority, the Department of Transportation and Communications and the agencies under it, and local government units coordinate their street and traffic plans to minimize traffic congestion? Imagine the billions of pesos squandered in lost man-hours, lost opportunities, lost wages, late deliveries, wasted fuel, etc. All because of stupid, or lack of, planning. It is as if all these government agencies are conniving to irritate the motoring public. Ano ba kuya?",Neal H.

In a bid bulletin, the transportation department said the deadline for the P2.5-billion project, which was rolled out on Dec. 27 last year, was moved from Dec. 1 to Dec. 12, 2014. The ITS system was designed to create intermodal hubs where provincial buses would disembark passengers to transfer to other in-city modes of transport such as MRT3 or LRT1, city buses and UV Express vans. The system is aimed at easing congestion in Metro Manila. The Southwest Terminal of the ITS project will be constructed on a 4.6-hectare land near the Manila-Cavite Expressway. The project will include passenger terminal buildings, arrival and departure bays, public information systems, ticketing and baggage handling facilities, and park-ride facilities. The private partner will undertake the design, construction, and financing of the ITS terminal as well as the operation and maintenance of the whole facility. It can also undertake commercial development and collect revenues generated from the same, information on the PPP Centers website showed.

2014-07-04,,,,"  A major risk to the economic growth story is the truck ban in Manila, ""an unwarranted exercise of power,"" University of Asia and the Pacific economist Vic Abola said during First Metro Investment Corp.'s mid-year briefing in Makati City.  ""They should revoke the ban, because it's just creating traffic in other places and it's not delivering the goods,"" he said.  ""The President needs to take action. Yes there's a problem, but the problem cannot be solved by one person,"" he added.  Last February, the from Manila's main thoroughfares from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m., a move that created a backlog in deliveries to, through and from the Port of Manila.  Covered by the ban are cargo trucks, gravel and sand trucks, cement mixers, eight-wheelers and any truck with a gross vehicle weight of at least 4,500 kilograms.  With the truck ban, cargo ships started forming a queue at the Port of Manila translating to higher freight costs and higher spoilage in terms of perishable products, Abola noted.  ""There are some importers that are taking two to four weeks to get the goods brought down to the port, and then the problem of getting them out,"" he said.  ""That's why we're seeing faster increase in food prices,"" he added.  Abola cited a Citi report which says economic losses from the truck ban could range between P61.2 billion to P320 billion.  ""We are already feeling it and this is being felt in inflation rates,"" he said.  Lower prices of alcoholic beverages, tobacco and utilities helped slow down to 4.4 percent from 4.5 percent in June, but was still on the higher end of the 3 to 5 percent government target, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reported.  The government should look for a long-term solution to the problem in traffic and transfer of goods, Abola said. ""But certainly, doing it overnight is not a solution.""  ""This requires a whole strategy of incentives and alternatives to make the system work consistent with the long term objective of moving more goods through Subic and Batangas,"" he added.      MMDA data showed there are 79,850 cargo trucks and 13,615 trailers plying the streets of Metro Manila each day.  But even with the truck ban, cargo volume still increased by 5 percent in the first quarter, Manila Vice Mayor Isko Moreno said in an e-mail to GMA News Online.  ""Data released by the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) showed that while cargo volume slowed down in the first quarter of the year, it still inched up close to 5 percent to 44.94 million metric tons compared with 42.942 million MT in the same period last year,"" he said.  The vice mayor said the problem on the supply side is not because of the truck ban, but in the port system of the country.  ""The problem of port congestion and system, or the lack of it, is something that the PPA and other concerned agencies should deal with,"" Moreno said.  ""In fact, as the good professor pointed out, the Port of Batangas and Subic are underutilized and it's high time for the national government to address this concern,"" he added.  The vice mayor went on to say the truck ban only highlighted the apparent inadequacies in the Philippine port system.  ""The effects of daytime truck ban is just being magnified but the fact is, there is already an existing truck ban from MMDA and we only added an hour in the morning and afternoon. Truckers have a 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. window... aside from the 24/7 Express Trade Lane we provided on Roxas Boulevard,"" Moreno said.  Last May 30, Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada said the city government and truck operators agreed to allow along Roxas Boulevard but the ban will remain in effect in other roads in the city.  However, UA&P's Abola said only 20 percent are able to use the express lane.  ""The number of trucks using express lane is only 20 percent so the truckers will have to charge higher fees, apart from the [fees] of shipping companies,"" he said.  Under the modified truck ban policy, only trucks loaded with deliveries are exempted from the ban from Mondays to Saturdays as long as they use designated routes.  Trucks without cargo will only be allowed to use roads in Manila from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., Mondays to Saturdays. ",DANESSA O.

2014-12-02,,,Vehicle users,"MANILA, PhilippinesA day after seeking a lifetime ban on the Maserati driver who mauled a traffic enforcer, Quezon City Rep. Winston Castelo has filed an anti-road rage bill that will impose stiffer penalties against those he termed monsters on wheels. Castelo filed House Bill No. 4910 to amend the Revised Penal Code and include road rage as an aggravating circumstance. Road rage can lead to altercations, assaults or collisions that result in injuries or even deaths, he said. In his explanatory note, Castelo defined road rage as aggressive or angry behavior by a driver of an automobile or other road vehicle. Castelo described such behavior as rude gestures, verbal insults, deliberately driving in an unsafe or threatening manner or making threats. Castelos bill will punish drivers with a minimum six-month suspension of their license. On Sunday, Castelo urged authorities to impose a lifetime ban on Joseph Russel Ingco, the driver of the Maserati who mauled a Metropolitan Manila Development Authority traffic constable. Castelo, chair of the House committee on Metro Manila development, said a perpetual driving ban on Ingco would serve as a lesson for hot-tempered motorists to refrain from unnecessarily venting their ire on traffic enforcers. Castelo said Ingco deserved the maximum punishment because this kind of monsters on wheels make the streets dangerous for other people. Meanwhile, Ingco reportedly had two gun licenses registered with the Philippine National Police but these had expired. Ingco owned a Glock 9-mm pistol and a high-powered Bushmaster rifle based on a check with the PNP Firearms and Explosives Office (FEO). Data from the FEOs Firearms Information Management System showed that Ingco, with registered address at Valencia Hills, New Manila, in Quezon City, had expired licenses for the two firearms. The license for the Glock was approved in August 2009 and expired in June 2011, while the Bushmaster license was approved in September 2010 and expired in June 2012.

2014-12-02,,,Vehicle users,"MANILA - A Maserati driver who allegedly assaulted a traffic enforcer is lamenting the call of a lawmaker that he be meted a lifetime driving ban, saying he did not even commit a traffic violation during the incident. Speaking to ABS-CBN's Umagang Kay Ganda, businessman Joseph Russel Ingco said traffic constable Jorbe Adriatico did not ask for his license when he made a U-turn on Araneta Avenue. Instead, he said Adriatico flagged him down for an alleged traffic violation and then shoved his phone in his face to take a video. ""Unang-una, hindi naman niya ako hiningan ng lisensiya. Idinuldul niya sa mukha ko yung video. Video agad ang sinasabi niya. Natural lang ang reaksyon ko hawiin. Talagang magagalit ka at hindi naman normal yun sa traffic enforcer na ganun ang gagawin sa iyo. Nasa mukha ko na po. Kung may violation ako, dapat ang sinabi 'Akin na yung lisensiya mo.' Ito ang violation,"" he said in an interview on ABS-CBN's Umagang Kay Ganda. Adriatico earlier accused Ingco of trying to make an illegal left turn at the corner of Quezon Avenue and Araneta Avenue before the latter changed his mind and made a U-turn. He also accused Ingco of shouting invectives at him, flashing a before trying to take his phone. He also accused the Maserati driver of punching him and breaking his nose while driving away from the site. In a separate interview, Ingco denied cursing the MMDA traffic enforcer, flashing the dirty finger at him or even trying to take his cellphone. He said that after he made the U-turn, Adriatico was already in the middle of the street and flagged him down. He said Adriatico told him: ""May video ka! May video ka!"" Ingco said he stopped his vehicle and rolled down his window to ask about his alleged violation since that was the right process. He said that when he shoved away the phone, Adriatico got mad and slapped him in the face. ""Hinampas niya ako sa mukha. Duon na ho nagsimula yun. Nagbubunuan na kami,"" he said, adding the Maserati was not moving during the altercation. He also said that Adriatico was trying to force him out of the vehicle. ""Sabi ko 'Bos, tama na.' Hanggang sa ginawa ko, unti-unti, inandar ko kasi gusto ko umalis siya sa akin. Kung mapapansin niyo, pumepreno rin iyon kasi nagpupula...Hindi siya bumibitaw,"" he said. Ingco said it is not possible that he was holding on to Adriatico while driving and at the same time punching the MMDA enforcer. He said that all throughout the altercation, it was Adriatico who held on to his shirt and would not let go. He said a video taken during the altercation showed that he was driving the car slowly in an effort to shake off the traffic enforcer. ""Hindi siya bumibitaw (motions to shirt lapel and arm). Nagbubunuan kami...Hinampas ko siya pero hindi siya bumibitaw. Tapos dinuduraan pa niya ako,"" he said. He said Ingco only let go after his shirt was torn off. In the interview, Ingco said he does not understand why he would be meted a . ""Bakit naman ho? Ako na nga ang na-agrabyado dito. Tapos kung iisipin natin pinara ako ng walang dahilan. Wala naman akong violation. Dinuldul sa mukha ko yung telepono. Minura ako, dinuraan ako. Kung titignan natin, ganito ba ang hustisya sa atin? Isang panig lang ang makikinig,"" he said in the UKG interview. He also noted that other motorists have complained about Adriatico's abusive behavior. He denied that he is paying other motorists to come forward against Adriatico, saying he did not even know about the complaints. Lawyer Ed Padernal, Ingco's counsel, said the only basis for revoking a driver's license is the motorist committed a traffic violation. ""There should be a grave reason to revoke the license,"" he said. For his part, Quezon City 2nd District Rep. Winston Castelo said he only wants a lifetime driving ban imposed on Ingco if he is found guilty of road rage. ""I want to send a message not just in this case but to the general public that we will impose a higher penalty if there is injury as a result of road rage,"" he said. The congressman admitted he has yet to speak to either Ingco or Adriatico. However, he said he talked to MMDA Chairman Francis Tolentino who said he stands by a preliminary investigation that Ingco may be the guilty party based on the testimony of other MMDA personnel and witnesses. Ingco urged the MMDA Chairman to again look at his case to see who is telling the truth. He also told Adriatico: ""You know what happened.

2014-08-20,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesSaying that the continuous implementation of the expanded truck ban in Manila and Joint Administrative Order (JAO) No. 2014-01 against colorum trucks may adversely affect the countrys economic growth, an official of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PCCI) has urged the government to put on hold the implementation of the two policies until the end of the year. PCCI president Alfredo M. Yao issued the appeal on Tuesday as he stressed that the worsening congestion problem at the Port of Manila would require the temporary suspension of both policies until port operations return to normal. We need to do these things slowly, depending on the capacity or how fast the agencies can process all the applications, Yao told reporters in an interview. There is no room anymore for finger-pointing as to who should be blamed. But we need to work on the remedy now and what we are suggesting is for us to go back to pre-February levels, meaning to have a situation without the expanded truck ban policy and other new policies, he said. Under the policy aimed at easing traffic flow in Manila, eight wheelers and vehicles with a gross weight of above 4,500 kilos have been barred from plying the citys streets between 5 a.m. and 9 p.m. As a concession to truckers groups who went on a trucking holiday to protest the move, the city government said they could also operate between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. Two 24/7 express trade lanes were also opened for their exclusive use on Roxas Boulevard and on Quirino Avenue-Osmea Highway and South Superhighway. On the other hand, JAO No. 2014-01 issued by the Department of Transportation and Communications, Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) and Land Transportation Office which took effect on June 19 imposed stricter fines on colorum vehicles. The penalty for first-time offenders was P1 million for buses, P200,000 for trucks and vans, P50,000 for jeepneys and P120,000 for cars.

According to the MMDA, traffic enforcers should not be intrusive when recording an incident on video. The enforcer should not put the camera near the face of a motorist. The MMDA also gives motorists the right to demand a copy of the video. The motorist can also capture the incident on video. 1. The use of video cameras should be traffic violation-related. 2. There should be a causal relationship between the event being recorded and the perceived traffic violation. 3. The video recording should not be intrusive. 4. The video recording should be sufficient enough for evidentiary purposes. 5. Should the other party request a copy, he or she should be given. 6. Assaults (verbal and physical) usually involving personal safety of the unarmed traffic enforcer can be video-taped subject to the nos. 1 - 5. 7. The enforcer can likewise be video-taped by the motorists or the general public subject to nos. 1 - 6. 8. In other cases involving public general safety, (i.e. snatching, holdups, fires or floods), the procedures mentioned can be used, taking into consideration the personal safety of the traffic enforcer.

2014-09-08,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesTake charge of decongesting the Port of Manila and easing the monstrous traffic gridlock in the metropolis if port, customs and transport officials could not resolve these matters soon, a political ally urged President Aquino on Sunday. Sen. Francis Escudero said the Senate committee investigating the issue might just make the suggestion as he noted the worsening traffic problems in Metro Manila. Its not that there are no other major problems that the President has to face. But this is a big problem and if his people are a failure, he has to take over because these people are just his alter ego, Escudero said over radio station dzBB. Its different if the President is giving the directions and reminders, compared to agencies that are on the same level and which sometimes resort to finger-pointing, he added. Escudero said statements from Palace spokespersons that something was being done were no longer enough because the traffic problem had been going on for so long. He also said an apology would not help a motorist stuck for three hours on the road, or unable to see his family for five or six hours. [W]hat people want is true and genuine service, and efficient service at that. Presidential spokesman Edwin Lacierda apologized on Saturday for the monster gridlock on the southbound lane of the North Luzon Expressway (NLEx) and on the roads leading to the Port of Manila on Friday. Commuters may find no relief in the next two weeks. Malacaang on Sunday appealed for a little sacrifice as the government begins moving Monday unclaimed freight containers out of the ports in Manila. Cargoes, many of which have been sitting there for more than three months, will be transferred to the Subic port in Zambales province. Communications Secretary Herminio Coloma said the movement of containers would have spillover effects on the flow of traffic, apparently similar to the horrendous congestion along NLExs southbound lane on Sept. 5. We need to sacrifice a little, especially in the next two weeks, Coloma said over Radyo ng Bayan. We advise the people to avoid the truck routes and look for alternative routes so they wont be caught in the gridlock. He said authorities were looking at significant and drastic reduction in the volume of containers occupying the Port of Manila. Last week, a Cabinet cluster agreed to give cargo owners until Sept. 8 to move their shipments out of the Manila port. Those that would be left unclaimed would be moved to Subic. By Oct. 1, cargo owners will be fined P5,000 for every day that their containers remained in the Manila port. Were asking for the cooperation of our port users, industry players and the citizens, Coloma said. From Sept. 7 to 8, truckers moving cargoes out of the Manila port were given special tags allowing them to take last mile and 24-hour express lanes. The same privilege will be in effect on Sept. 14 and 15 to help speed up the decongestion at the port. Cabinet Secretary Jose Rene Almendras earlier reminded container owners that ports were not supposed to serve as their warehouses. He said many containers had been kept in the Manila port for 90 days. Expecting more imports during the remainder of the year, the government decided to take drastic steps to decongest the port, Almendras said. If container owners would cooperate, he said, the decongestion could be completed during the two-week period. Escudero said people were waiting for solutions, answers and specific plans about the road gridlock with a specific timeframe. I think people deserve and demand efficient service given to them and delivered by government, he said. Escudero said the traffic problem relating to port congestion was due to a confluence of factors. These include the Manila truck ban and the stricter rules of the Bureau of Customs and the Bureau of Internal Revenue, with the latter requiring a National Bureau of Investigation clearance for importers. There is also the lack of roads in and around the ports, and there is a need for a more efficient system of running the ports. The Philippine Ports Authority, Bureau of Customs, port operators and the private sector must all sit down to iron out the kinks in the system. They must sit and talk among themselves because it is hard to make people follow orders, Escudero said. He also noted that the holidays are coming and importers are expected to bring in more goods, which will add to the port congestion. The delays in delivery of goods could also jack up the inflation rate, he warned. The problem doesnt need a rocket scientist to solve, but an expert in time-and-motion study who would be able to determine the most efficient way of managing the movements in the ports, according to the senator. He said he had asked port officials to submit such a study during the next hearing. Sen. Ralph Recto said the country must work double time to resolve traffic and security problems and the state of the airport to ensure it would be prepared for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit next year, which would have the heads of 21 governments converging in Metro Manila. If Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin will hug and pose for a selfie in November next year, will they be doing it in a metropolis that international reporters covering the Apec summit will hail as safe and clean? Recto asked in a statement. Or will the traditional class picture of Apec leaders have cargo trucks stuck in traffic as background? he added. Recto also suggested that Congress audit the Apec requirements during the national budget hearings. The administration has sought a P4.6-billion budget for the International Commitments Funds, but Recto thinks this would just be for hosting requirements and excludes the outside-of-venue needs, such as improving airport facilities. He said there were also allocations in the 2015 budget that point to a crash Metro Manila makeover. There is a P1.9-billion allocation for the rehabilitation of Edsa. There is another P1.9 billion to repair flyovers. There is P600 million for the repair of Naia (Ninoy Aquino International Airport). In the budget of the DPWH (Department of Public Works and Highways), there is at least P30 billion worth of projects, which will be implemented in (Metro Manila), he said. He also noted that the Manila International Airport Authority had an annual net income of P3 billion, a portion of which could be used to spruce up passenger-comfort facilities. While not all projects may be attributable to the Apec summit, those scheduled to be finished before the international event must be completed by then, Recto said. For those that will not, there must be a traffic management program so that gridlock would not mar the summit, he added.",,", | 2:08 AM | Monday, September 8th, 2014",,yes,2014-09-08 00:00:00,truck ban,,,,,,,,english,,http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/635997/take-charge-of-traffic-problem-aquino-urged,,"zambales, metro manila, manila",text,,444.0,,2361.0,,candice,,,truck ban,5.5,Straight News,,,,,,inquirer,no,no,,,,"Take charge of traffic problem, Aquino urged | Inquirer News",Neutral,,

2014-12-03,,,,"MANILA, Philippines - Businessman Joseph Russel Ingcos blue Maserati Ghibli sports car was unregistered when his run-in with traffic enforcer Jorbe Adriatico happened last week, the Land Transportation Office said yesterday. When we checked our database, the car was still not registered at that time, LTO spokesman Jason Salvador said in an interview. As this developed, the LTO started its investigation on the complaint filed by the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority, asking to revoke the license of Ingco, over his actions when he allegedly roughed up Adriatico last week. We have already placed the license of Mr. Ingco under alarm while awaiting the results of the investigation, Salvador said. According to Salvador, they are checking if Ingco could be held liable for reckless driving and commission of a crime in the course of apprehension. He noted that based on Adriaticos complaint, Ingco continued driving while punching the traffic enforcer, thus, endangering his life, that of Adriatico and those of other motorists and persons on the road. Salvador said these violations, if proven during the investigation, carries a maximum penalty  the revocation of Ingcos drivers license. Ingcos lawyer, Edgar Padernal, said there was no ground to revoke his clients license since he has not been convicted of any crime. As for the reckless driving charge, Padernal said Ingco could not have been driving recklessly since he was not even speeding when he drove his Maserati as he punched Adriatico, supposedly so the traffic enforcer would let go of him. Padernal said Ingco was compelled to drive only because he needed to get away from Adriaticos grip. He also said Ingco cannot be held accountable for the failure to register the sports car, as he had signed all the papers needed for the process  the responsibility to register the car lies with Maseratis local distributor, from which Ingco bought his Ghibli.

2014-09-13,,,,"MANILA, Philippines  Former president and now Manila Mayor Joseph Ejercito Estrada on Saturday lifted the truck ban in Manila. Estrada, in a televised press conference, said the lifting of the ban that started at 12 noon, was contained in Executive Order No. 67 and would be in effect indefinitely. Pursuant to the executive order, truck lanes were removed and trucks will now be allowed to enter the city anytime of the day. He said he was heeding the request of the national government to lift the truck ban to ease traffic congestion. I am avoiding the conflict kaya we withdraw and let the national government take over, he said. He, however, clarified that the lifting of the truck ban was voluntary saying there was no pressure from Malacanang or from the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH). We are giving them (the leeway) so they wont blame us, he said. The Manila truck ban has been criticized by truckers and various sectors as it has done nothing to ease congestion in the citys ports. Ithas also been blamed for the recent traffic gridlock experienced by motorists and commuters at the North Luzon Expressway (Nlex) and on roads leading to Manila. Estrada, however, said that the ports have been congested even before the city government implemented the truck ban. The Manila truck ban ordinance was implemented in February 2014.Cargo trucks were not allowed on the citys main roads from 5:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. Trucks were only allowed to ply designated truck lanes.

2014-09-16,,,,"MANILA, Philippines - Police and military officials operating trucking firms at Port Area, Manila had lobbied for the lifting of the truck ban in the capital, Manila Vice Mayor Isko Moreno bared yesterday. He told reporters during the weekly Kapihan sa Diamond Hotel news forum that high-ranking police officials often meddle in the arrest of truck drivers who violated traffic ordinance in Manila. They (generals) want us to clear the streets with tricycles, but allow the trucks to park in certain areas, he said. He added that these police officials have practically cannibalized the Manila Traffic and Parking Bureau by pulling out policemen detailed in that office. Moreno also observed that most of the trucks operated by military and police officials bear green plates, an indication that they have no franchise from the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board. Moreno, however, declined to identify the military and police officials who own allegedly trucking firms that have not been cooperating with traffic management in the capital. With the lifting of the truck ban last week, Moreno said Task Force Pantalan was activated to manage traffic in the roads leading to Port Area. However, the task force members armed with assault rifles are not really helping manage traffic. Members of the task force are often seen loitering at the Guapo Hotel, Moreno bared. Erap: Nothing to do with Jinggoy Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada said yesterday that speculations that he lifted the truck ban because the active generals who own trucking firms have threatened to transfer his son, detained Sen. Jinggoy Estrada who is facing plunder charges over the pork barrel fund scam, to a more difficult detention facility is farfetched. It has nothing to do with that, Estrada told The STAR in a telephone interview. Estrada maintained that he lifted the truck ban because he does not want bloodshed between Task Force Pantalan members and the traffic enforcers and policemen who were implementing the truck ban. He said the deployment of Task Force Pantalan members in full battle gear to the ports could trigger trouble. They might engage themselves in gunbattle because the two sides have policemen. I dont want that to happen. The deployment of the heavily armed Task Force Pantalan personnel in full battle gear may provoke bloodshed, Estrada explained. He also said that the suspension of the truck ban is indefinite and intended to give the national government a free hand in managing traffic and decongesting the ports. If I see the traffic will worsen even if the truck ban is lifted, I could immediately implement it again. Let us see if they can decongest the Port Area, he said. MMDA: Light traffic in Port Area Meanwhile, traffic at the Port Area was light during yesterdays rush hour with the lifting of the truck ban, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) said. But MMDA Traffic Discipline Office head Crisanto Saruca said that while the lifting of the truck ban was helpful, the impact on traffic flow still needs to be qualified. The MMDA, he noted, would still have to conduct a vehicle count to determine exactly how the lifting of Manilas truck ban has affected traffic flow at Port Area. We cannot yet evaluate the impact of the lifting of Manilas truck ban. The Metro Manila Council will still need to meet about that, Saruca added. No effect yet in other cities But local officials of the neighboring cities of Caloocan, Malabon and Navotas said that they have not yet felt the effect of the truck ban lifting. Caloocan, Malabon and Navotas are the common passing points of trucks going to the Port Area in Manila. The three cities are also home to truck depots and are straddling Dagat-dagatan Avenue, which had practically become a parking area for truck drivers waiting for the window hours or the period they are allowed to travel. So far, there is no effect in Caloocan City as far as the lifting of the truck ban in Manila is concerned. In the past, we have three lanes in Caloocan but when the trucks get to Manila, they only have one lane. So there is a tough gridlock in our city, Caloocan Mayor Oscar Malapitan said. Malabon City welcomes any effort to solve the traffic problem, but the effect of the truck ban lifting in the city is also not yet felt. The truck ban lifting also has no effect in the traffic woes in Navotas City, but the local government is closely monitoring the situation and is ready to take action if the situation calls for it, Navotas City public order and traffic management chief Nanie Calayag said. Actually the trucks are not really a problem because we have wider roads. But when traffic spills to Caloocan and Malabon, then inadvertently we are affected, Calayag added. The local government of Quezon City also wants to be clarified on the details of the lifting of the truck ban. Elmo San Diego, head of Quezon Citys Department of Public Order and Safety, said he wants to know whether the lifting of the truck ban would be for the whole day or whether the past setup of allowing trucks to ply their routes only within certain periods during the day and night would be followed. Local government officials from different cities of the metropolis are expected to meet today to discuss specific details of the truck ban lifting, he added. But San Diego said the Quezon City government expects that the lifting of the truck ban would have a generally positive effect on traffic situations along major roads in the city.

2014-12-03,,,,"We commendTransportation Secretary Joseph Emilio Abaya for recognizing the ingenuity of entrepreneurial mobile app taxicab-for-hires like Uber (Revolutionary colorum, Opinion, 11/28/14). This may yet revolutionize our public transport industry into providing our riding public comfortable, convenient and safe rides. Not only that, also courteous and thoughtful driversand all this on affordable rates. Such service will doubtless significantly help promote Philippine tourism. Ideas and practices, along with technologies that can move the country forward, should be encouraged, adopted and rewardednot penalized. People in government must bear in mind that it is the public interest they must serve and protect, above all. Just recently, we had a weeklong workshop at Ateneo de Manila University in Loyola Heights. When the workshop ended and we were eager to go home, we checked out as soon as we could and walked all the way from our lodging house to Katipunan where we waited quite a while for an empty cab on a Friday-night rush hour to take us to the bus terminal. You can imagine the experience we had with cab drivers who either snubbed us, or rejected us, or imposed conditionsin other words, treated us rudely and haughtily. As a commuter, I fully agree with the position of Secretary Abaya because it is clearly in pursuance of his departments mandate of delivering public service to the riding public. The interest of the complaining taxi operators must be considered, but taxi operation is impressed with public interest that is superior to personal or business interests. Also, taxi operators must realize that they are in a competitive environment where operational efficiency, passenger convenience, the roadworthiness of vehicles and courteous drivers are critical factors in drawing customers.

2014-12-03,,,,"MANILA - Muling ipagbabawal ng Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) ang pagdaan ng mga cargo truck at ibang mabibigat na sasakyan sa Roxas Boulevard simula Miyerkules. Tatagal ng anim na buwan ang muling pagbabawal sa pagdaan ng mga truck sa Roxas Bouelvard. Sa abiso ng MMDA, maaari pa ring baybayin ng mga truck ang kanilang mga ruta ngunit kailangan nilang iwasan ang Roxas Boulevard. Ang pagpasa ng resolusyon ng MMDA ay bunsod sa mga gaganaping pagdaraos katulad ng pagdating sa bansa ni Pope Francis, ang Traslacion ng Poong Nazareno at ang ng Asia Pacific Cconomic Cooperation summit sa bansa. Nakadagdag din ang mga road project tulad ng NAIA Elevated Expressway sa dahilan ng pagpapatupad ng truck ban, dahil inaasahan na mas dadami ang mga motoristang dadaan sa Roxas Boulevard. Tinatayang nasa halos 80,000 na mga cargo truck at halos 14,000 mga trailer truck ang bumabaybay sa mga kalsada sa Metro Manila. Ikinabahala naman ni MMDA chairman Francis Tolentino na baka hindi umabot sa mga pagdaraos ang pagtatapos ng road repair sa gitna ng kalsada sa Roxas Boulevard. Aniya, baka abutan pang may lubak ang kalsada sa pagdating ni Pope Francis.

2014-12-04,,,,"MANILA - The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority on Thursday ordered the immediate suspension of a traffic constable who was caught on video taking a bribe while allowing buses to pick up passengers near a mall on EDSA. A video taken by Jay Ramirez and posted on the Top Gear Facebook page showed the traffic enforcer sitting on the curb and then approaching a bus conductor to accept the bribe. In his post, Ramirez said he had already complained about the traffic enforcer on the MMDA website but got no feedback. ""This is an MMDA traffic officer at Starmall on EDSA-Shaw. He doesn't do his job and he just sits around. He only stands up to collect money from the buses (P20 per bus). I see this almost every day. Sorry for the vertical video recording. I had to record this stealthily,"" he said. MMDA Chairman Francis Tolentino said the traffic constable involved in the ""kotong"" incident will remain suspended pending investigation of the case wherein due process of the law will be observed. He said that he will not tolerate illegal street activities among MMDA personnel and encouraged the use of video cameras by motorists and the general public to help attain a disciplined society as well as for evidentiary purposes. The suspension comes a week after another traffic enforcer was by a driver of a Maserati after the constable allegedly took his video. Traffic enforcer Jorbe Adriatico said he took the video after driver Joseph Russel Ingco flashed a dirty finger at him and cursed him. Ingco, however, said Adriatico flagged him down and accused him of a traffic violation even though none happened.",,ABS-CBNnews.com,Metropolitan Manila Development Authority,yes,2014-12-04 00:00:00,enforcement of existing lawsordinances,,,,,,,,english,,http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/12/04/14/watch-traffic-enforcer-caught-taking-kotong,,manila,text,,335.0,,2027.0,,mavie,,,traffic enforcement and violations,6.0,Straight News,,,,,,abs-cbnnews,no,no,,,,WATCH: Traffic enforcer caught taking 'kotong',Neutral,,
2014-12-05,,,Civil society,"MANILA, PhilippinesRight after he ordered the suspension of a traffic constable caught on video receiving bribes from bus conductors, Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) Chair Francis Tolentino urged the public on Thursday to take videos of any MMDA personnel involved in illegal activities and upload the footage on the Metro Solusyon website. I am encouraging motorists and the general public as well to use video cameras to record and document perceived illegal or unlawful activities by our employees or by anybody to help attain a disciplined society, and also for evidentiary purposes, Tolentino said. On Wednesday, a two-minute video uploaded on the Facebook page of car magazine Top Gear Philippines showed an MMDA traffic constable collecting money from the conductors of buses picking up passengers in front of a mall near the Edsa-Shaw Boulevard intersection. The netizen who took the video asked other people to share it, saying he had yet to hear from the MMDA after he brought it to the agencys attention. He doesnt do his job and he just sits around. He only stands up to collect money from the buses (P20 per bus). I see this almost every day, he added. Since its posting, the video has gone viral, generating 400,000 views in just 24 hours. It has also been shared by around 8,000 Facebook users. In response, Tolentino said the MMDA had suspended indefinitely the traffic enforcer whom it refused to identify. If proven guilty, he faces possible termination from the service, he added. At the same time, Tolentino stressed that he would not tolerate any of his mens involvement in illegal activities as he urged the public to capture their activities on video and upload the clip on the agencys Metro Solusyon website (www.metrosolusyon.mmda.gov.ph.). The public can report complaints or incidents involving MMDA employees, laud or commend a good deed done by MMDA personnel through the website, the agency said in a statement. The MMDA has been criticized by the Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption (VACC) and Commission on Human Rights (CHR) in the past few days for its policy of encouraging its personnel to videotape motorists who violate traffic regulations after one of its traffic constable, Jorbe Adriatico, accused a Maserati-driving businessman, Joseph Russel Ingco, of punching him last month. According to Adriatico, Ingco became angry when he saw that the traffic constable was videotaping his movements, including his earlier attempt to make an illegal U-turn at the corner of Araneta and Quezon Avenues. The VACC said the policy was a violation of a persons privacy since the footage may be used by criminals, including kidnappers, scouting for victims. The CHR, meanwhile, expressed concern over the policy, saying it should first be studied. Tolentino, however, said the videos taken by its personnel serve the same purpose as those captured by closed-circuit television cameras. He also stressed that under the MMDAs rules on the use of video cameras, there should be a causal relationship between the event being recorded and the perceived traffic violation. In addition, the video recording should not be intrusive and used only as evidence against the party involved. The motorist can also ask for a copy of the footage, according to the MMDA.",Maricar B.

2014-12-11,,,,"MANILA, Philippines - The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) might issue a decision on the fare reduction petition for passenger jeepneys before yearend. Were looking into coming out with the ruling this year, LTFRB chairman Winston Ginez said. Currently, the board is studying a petition filed by Negros Oriental Rep. Manuel Iway last month to reduce the minimum fare of jeepneys from P8.50 to P8 because of the series of rollbacks in fuel prices. The board, however, is in the process of seeking inputs from other transport groups before it decides. Iway was former board member of the LTFRB before becoming a lawmaker. Similarly, the group Pasang Masda asked the LTFRB for the institutionalization of a fare adjustment mechanism with a conditional prayer for fare reduction. The group said the LTFRB must be able to fast-track hearings on such petitions, basing the decision on historical prices of fuel. The group cited that historically, the minimum fare should be at P8 once diesel prices hit P37 per liter. On the other hand, minimum fare should be at P8.50 once diesel prices are at P49 per liter.

From the previous standard fare of P8.50, the LTFRB issued a provisional decrease on fare rate by P1. LTFRB Chairman Winston Ginez said the rollback will also affect the discounted fare for students and senior citizens, reducing it to P6.00 for the first four kilometers. A transport group, who earlier slammed the LTFRB for increasing jeepney fare by only 50 centavos, said it welcomes the fare rollback. George San Mateo, national president of Piston (Pagkakaisa ng mga Samahan ng Tsuper at Operator Nationwide), pointed out that, alongside the rollback, the government and its regulatory agencies should lower prices of basic commodities and services. Instead of passing the burden to poor jeepney drivers earning only up to P400 in a day, San Mateoasked the administration to lower shipping costs, air freight rates and Metro Rail Transit and Light Rail Transit fare. Jeepney drivers are earning way below theP466 minimum wage. Theyre also living way below thegovernments mandated daily living wage of P1,063 per day of a family of six, he said.

Traffic at the North EDSA area was at a virtual standstill as of 6:30 p.m., due to the sheer volume of vehicles, GMA News' Susan Enriquez reported on ""24 Oras.""  While the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) deployed traffic constables to various points of EDSA, there was little they could do to get traffic moving fast.  Filipinos have been rushing to get to various venues either to shop for gifts or to attend Christmas parties.

The MMDA said this phenomenon  where traffic was still heavy past 11 p.m.  was due to the shopping rush.  For the holidays, the MMDA had unveiled Christmas and Airport Loops to ease motorists and commuters' woes.  The routes involve four airport loops and four Christmas loops.  Other measures the MMDA has taken to ease traffic include:  - the 11-to-11 mall operating hours - Pasig River Ferry System's extended operating hours - moratorium on reblocking - moratorium on road repair starting Dec. 15 - posting of traffic enforcers in major malls at EDSA - heightened MMDA visibility during the Christmas season - Roxas Boulevard bicycle lane - EDSA Christmas shuttle - Airport shuttle    On the other hand, a separate report by GMA News' Cedric Castillo said it took his team a little over an hour to get from Quezon City to Makati City using MMDA's Blue Christmas Loop.  Instead of EDSA, the team passed parts of San Juan City to get to the Guadalupe area in Makati City.  The distance traveled?

2014-12-15,,,,"      Taxi operators found breaching the provisions of the MC will be meted a penalty of P5,000 per violation.  Dahil sa sunud-sunod na mga insidente na sangkot ang ilang mga taxi drivers sa pagsasagawa ng krimen katulad ng holdap, rape at iba pagsasamantala sa mga mananakay, kailangan nating magpatupad ng ordinansa upang masawata ang ganitong mga masamang tangka sa publiko, LTFRB chairman Atty. Winston Ginez said in a statement.  The regulator noted a sharp increase in the number of complaints against discourteous, arrogant, dishonest and irresponsible drivers while several passengers were victimized by drivers and their accomplices.  As part of our mandate in ensuring the safety of the people, we need to act to protect the riding public from these criminals disguising as legitimate taxi drivers, Ginez said.    All taxi operators in Metro Manila must submit a list of their authorized drivers in soft and hard copies to the LTFRB Information and System Management Division (ISMD) on or before January 15, 2015, together with an affidavit attesting that the list is complete and names of the drivers are all legitimate.  The operators are also required to update their list by to submitting to ISMD the names and other details of their drivers who are no longer authorized to drive their units, as well as new authorized drivers, every 15th and 30th of the month.  Taxi operators were also ordered to issue identification cards to their authorized drivers with contents and design to be prescribed by the Board.  Taxi drivers must conspicuously hang the IDs in the rear view mirror of the taxi units.  Drivers without IDs are barred from driving their units.  Non-compliant drivers also face penalties, the LTFRB said.  Once the MC takes effect, taxi drivers must secure an LTFRB certificate to verify their employment history and check if there are any pending complaints against them.    Taxi operators face cancellation, suspension or revocation of their franchise if their driver fails to secure the LTFRB certificate.  The drive was launched with the support of the Land Transportation Office Department of Transportation and Communications Action Center, PNP-HPG and DILG Emergency No. 117.  It was also supported by the Philippine National Taxi Operators Association, Association of Taxi Operators of Metro Manila, Airport Transport Concessionaires Association Inc. and National Center for Commuter Safety Protection to launch the drive against taxi crimes.  The LTFRB said it is intensifying the speedy resolution of passenger complaints against erring taxi drivers.  Its Public Assistance and Complaint Desk will immediately call to a conference the driver, operator and the complainant once they received a complaint. If the complainant is not able to attend the conference, a show cause letter shall be sent to the operator to explain his side regarding the said complaint.  In case an amicable settlement or agreement is not reached, the board will require the complainant to submit statement detailing the complaint.  Taxi operators found to be at fault will be penalized as stipulated in the Joint Administrative Order No.2014-001. If the driver is at fault, LTFRB will make the proper notation in its records and refer its findings and recommendation to the Land Transportation Office for investigation and imposition of the appropriate fine or penalty.

2014-12-03,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesThe Manila City government has complained of feeling left out, saying it was not consulted by the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) which announced the other day that it would be implementing a six-month truck ban on Roxas Boulevard starting Wednesday. We will definitely be seeking an explanation from the MMDA, Vice Mayor Francisco Isko Moreno Domagoso said in a phone interview on Tuesday. We were not consulted about what they intend to do. We only found out about it in the news. Whatever happened to our supposed local autonomy? There are elected officials in Manila who have the obligation to attend to the citys problems, he added. Domagoso, however, stressed that despite the lack of consultation, the city government would not block the MMDAs new traffic policy. We dont want to be branded as uncooperative. I believe in road regulation which is the only measure available to us today to address traffic congestion. But the long-term solution would be to develop our road network, with duplicating our roads through overpasses and tunnels as the easiest solution, he said. Domagoso noted that the truck ban on Roxas Boulevard was contradictory to the national governments earlier request for the city government to lift its expanded truck ban. I dont know what theyre trying to address here. But this will certainly cause confusion. Before, they were blaming our truck ban for the port congestion and heavy traffic. Now they want it back, he said, referring to the Manila ordinance that imposed longer hours during which heavy vehicles were prohibited from using major streets in the city. It was lifted indefinitely in September by Mayor Joseph Estrada who also agreed to open an express lane for the exclusive use of truckers on Roxas Boulevard to speed up the decongestion of the Manila ports. Reached for comment on Tuesday, MMDA Chair Francis Tolentino said that he was planning to call up Domagoso in order to explain. As announced by the MMDA on Monday, trucks and other heavy vehicles with a gross weight of 4,500 kilograms would be banned from plying Roxas Boulevard. The measure will be in place for six months starting today following its approval by the Metro Manila Councils Special Traffic Committee. It was recommended by Tolentino in preparation for the upcoming visit of Pope Francis in January and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit which are expected to cause heavy traffic in Manila, including Roxas Boulevard. As a concession, however, truckers would be allowed to ply their old routes (South Superhighway-Port Area and vice versa, North Diversion Road-Port Area and vice versa, Marcos Highway-Port Area) to and from Manila ports 24/7 except on Dec. 24, 25 and 31 and Jan. 1.",Nathaniel R.

He announced that from Dec. 17 to 22, trucks will be allowed from midnight to 5 a.m. to help decongest the port of Manila. Tolentino made the announcement on radio a day after he turned down a request by the Port Congestion Multi-Sectoral Working Group to allow trucks to use Roxas Boulevard to keep goods moving as more shipments arrive at the port. Tolentino said the MMDA imposed the truck ban for the people and in preparation for the Papal visit next year. He said passengers of domestic airlines going to the airport during the holiday rush have priority over trucks. Tolentino also urged truck operators to adjust their schedule on Dec. 19, saying traffic gridlocks are expected along major roads in Metro Manila.

The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) advised commuters to brace themselves for the worst today as it noted that the last Friday before Christmas was considered the most crucial day of the year by mall owners and operators. Based on the data provided by mall managers, the last Friday before Dec. 25 is the day they register their highest sales in a year, said MMDA Chair Francis Tolentino. With people expected to troop to malls to do some last-minute shopping before Christmas, traffic will be very heavy on roads near shopping centers, particularly on Edsa where 15 malls are located, he said. Earlier, the MMDA and Edsa mall owners agreed upon an open late-close late system (from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m.) from Nov. 28 to Jan. 3 to help ease traffic on one of busiest thoroughfares in the metropolis. At the same time, the MMDA designated alternate routes for motorists bound for major shopping malls so that people could avoid Edsa.

2014-12-20,,,Vehicle users,"MANILA, PhilippinesA traffic constable of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) was in critical condition after being run over by a private vehicle he had flagged down for a road violation on Edsa in Quezon City on Friday morning. Police said Sonny Acosta, an MMDA enforcer assigned in the Cubao area, spotted a Mitsubishi Adventure (AAB-4197) moving on a lane designated for provincial buses and motioned the driver to stop around 9:45 a.m. But as Acosta was about to confiscate the license of the still unidentified driver, the motorist allegedly rolled up his window and suddenly drove off, according to Supt. Ely Pintang, chief of the Traffic Enforcement Unit of the Quezon City Police District. Acosta got his hand stuck in the window and dragged by the Adventure for several meters until his body went under the moving vehicle, Pintang said. The incident happened on a section of Edsa in front of Farmers Market. Acosta sustained serious injuries in the head and body and at press time had a 50-50 chance of survival at the St. Lukes Medical Center in Quezon City, Pintang said. The QCPD-TEU was still validating records of the Land Transportation Office (LTO) showing that the Adventure is owned by a resident of San Miguel, Bulacan province. Last month, another MMDA traffic enforcer, Jorbe Adriatico, emerged bloodied from an encounter with a Maserati-driving motorist in Quezon City.

2014-12-20,,,Civil society,"MANILA, PhilippinesWith commuters already fed up with monstrous traffic gridlocks, it is time for a mind shift and road diet. Environmentalist lawyer Antonio Oposa Jr. on Friday called for a mind shift on transportation, which would steer people to walk and use bicycles and other more sustainable modes of transportation. At present, Oposa noted that most people dream of owning cars, which just clog up the roads. Its a 180 degree mind shift from roads that are meant for vehicles to roads that are meant for people; from bias for private transportation to bias for public transportation; from wasting space to the efficient use of space; from road widening to road diet, Oposa told a Senate hearing on sustainable transportation and encouraging bicycle use. He said this road diet meant narrowing part of the roads reserved for vehicles and devoting more space for sidewalks for pedestrians and bicycle lanes. He also said it was unfair that majority of the road is devoted for vehicles, when less than one percent of the population in the Philippines owns cars. And yet this majority have no proper place on the road. People who dont have cars are not even given a proper sidewalk, proper bike lane, not even given a proper option, he said. He said this was unequal protection of the law and discrimination against the poor. Oposa said he was not against cars, and in fact has one. But he would rather not have a car and instead have efficient public transportation, he said. He said this road diet had been proven successful in other countries, such as Amsterdam. He also said there were several good examples of efficient public transport in the country, though these were just in certain areas and not widely practiced. These include a tricycle rapid transit where several of the vehicles are tied together, and only the one in the lead is running and is towing the others. There are also self-contained renewable energy transport vehicles in Cebu which are solar powered, he noted. He said it was so easy to put in place more efficient means of public transportation. We dont need money, we just need a little imagination, he said, adding that people should not underestimate the genius of Filipinos. Oposa also said building more roads was not the solution to traffic problems, and said this was like trying to fight a fire by pouring gasoline instead of water. Sen. Pia Cayetano, who chaired the hearing, also called for a sense of creativity to look for ways to come up with sustainable and alternative modes of transportation. Such measures are intended to increase efficiency, improve peoples health, improve air quality, and reduce congestion. Biking is one form of transportation being promoted, but Cayetano noted that it was difficult to encourage such an activity in Metro Manila. Though the Metro Manila Development Authority has designated bike lanes in several cities, few are using these because of safety concerns. These lanes are also not connected to each other, making it difficult to go from one city to another. There is also a lack of facilities such as bike racks in public areas, including train stations. Cayetanos sustainable transportation bill seeks to install three-meter sidewalks to encourage people to walk and to ensure the safety of pedestrians. It also seeks to require cities and municipalities to designate bike lanes, and for certain buildings to have bicycle parking spaces and bike racks. The measure also seeks to promote the water ferry system and a bus rapid transit system.",Leila B.

The Sportivos driver, however, denied the allegation and asked for the closed circuit television (CCTV) footage of the incident on Friday morning along Edsa in Cubao, Quezon City. Mark Ian Libunao, a 35-year-old family driver, was arrested in San Miguel, Bulacan, between 8 p.m. to 9p.m. on Friday, according to Supt. Ely Pintang, chief of the Traffic Enforcement Unit of the Quezon City Police District. The driver of the Isuzu Sportivo (not a Mitsubishi Adventure as earlier reported) was flagged down by MMDA traffic enforcer Sonny Acosta, 38, for moving along the lane designated for provincial buses. According to witnesses, when Acosta asked for the motorists license, the driver rolled up his window and drove off, Rechille, the wife of the traffic enforcer said. Acostas hand got stuck thats why it remained purplish and swollen, she added Were not sure what happened after that. His fellow MMDA traffic enforcers just saw him lying on the ground with blood all over him, He remained in critical condition at the St. Lukes Medical Center in Quezon City because his head was badly injured, she added. But Libuanao said, I never hit anyone. Our vehicle doesnt even have a single scratch. But if theres a CCTV footage then theres nothing I can do. Records of the Land Transportation Office showed that the Isuzu Sportivo with license plate no. AAB4197 was registered to Dante F. Borguete, whose license expired on Sept. 3, 2013. Pintang said Libunao was driving for Borguetes father-in-law. We did not focus on the passengers. Whats important is we were able to establish that Libunao was the driver, he added. A case of reckless imprudence resulting to serious physical injuries was filed yesterday against Libunao. Acosta, who has three daughters, is the familys sole breadwinner. His youngest childis just 6 months old. Rechille, a housewife, described his husband as hardworking. He makes it a point to have a perfect attendance every year, she added. The MMDA paid an initial deposit of P100,000 for Acostas hospitalization. But it could reach up a million pesos if Acosta stayed for 10 days with operation, Rechille said. St. Lukes had asked for a guarantee from the MMDA to shoulder the hospital expenses.

2014-12-21,,,,"MANILA, Philippines In line with the celebration of the upcoming holiday season, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) announced the suspension of the number coding scheme in Metro Manila for 13 days. The Unified Vehicular Volume Reduction Program (UVVRP), commonly known was the number coding scheme, will be lifted in the metro from Dec. 23-Jan. 4, according to Cris Saruca, head of the MMDA Traffic Discipline Office during the agencys weekly radio program. MMDA Chair Francis Tolentino told members of the media on Friday said that this announcement would be in line with the Christmas and New Year celebration and holidays where many would go home to the provinces resulting in lesser vehicles along metro roads. Tolentino, however, warned the public to expect heavy traffic along roads near bus terminals and airports because people would surely flock there in the days leading to the holiday celebration. Under the UVVRP, some vehicles are prohibited from plying major roads in the metro from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. depending on the last digit of their vehicles license plate. In Makati City, expect heavy traffic as the local government is lifting its number coding scheme on selected days during the holidays. According to a post on its local traffic units Twitter account on Saturday, the scheme will be lifted on Dec. 24, 25, 26, 30 and 31. The number coding will also not be in effect on Jan. 1 and Jan. 2, it said. The suspension came a day after the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority announced the lifting of the number coding scheme in Metro Manila. In an interview over radio dzMM on Saturday, Tolentino said the suspension would be in place on Dec. 23. That will be until Jan. 4 already, that is kind of long. Although (Dec. 29) is a (regular workday) we already included that (in the days when number coding is suspended), he said. Aside from this effort for the holidays, the MMDA has deployed an additional 443 personnel along major streets in Metro Manila especially along Edsa to manage traffic and help motorists avoid delays in their travels. The agency also designated alternate routes for those going to the malls and the airports as it noted that the traffic volume along metro roads has risen about 15 to 20 percent a month before the holiday season because of shoppers going to the malls and passengers headed to the airports.

2014-12-21,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesThe driver of a sport utility vehicle who ran over a traffic constable of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) on Edsa-Cubao, Quezon City, on Friday morning has been charged with reckless imprudence resulting in serious physical injuries and driving with an expired license. In a statement issued on Sunday, the MMDA said that the Quezon City Prosecutors Office filed the criminal complaint against Mark Ian Libunaothe driver of the Isuzu Sportivoon behalf of traffic constable Sonny Acosta. Libunao immediately escaped after running over Acosta but was arrested in San Miguel, Bulacan, on Friday night with the help of the vehicle owner Dante Borguete, said Superintendent Ely Pintang, chief of the Traffic Enforcement Unit of the Quezon City Police District. According to the MMDA, Quezon City Assistant Prosecutor Corazon Romano recommended a bail bond of P8,000 for the 35-year-old family drivers provisional release. Meanwhile, Acosta has remained in the intensive care unit of a private hospital in Quezon City due to serious head injuries, MMDA Traffic Discipline Office head Cris Saruca said in the agencys Sunday radio program. He is now in an induced coma and there is still no advice on until when he will remain in the hospital. The doctors are still waiting for his condition to stabilize before they operate on his brain, Saruca added. In a post on the agencys Facebook page on Sunday, MMDA Chair Francis Tolentino asked for prayers for the 38-year-old traffic enforcer whose condition has worsened. As of 11 a.m. on Dec. 20, MMDA Traffic Constable Sonny Acostas health has further deteriorated and [he is] still unconscious. He has a six-month-old baby girl. We need your prayers, he said. The police caught Libunao after they traced the Sportivo to Borguete who said that the suspect was the one using the vehicle at the time of the accident. Based on police reports, the MMDA traffic constable flagged down the suspects vehicle at 9:45 p.m. on Friday and asked for his drivers license after the former spotted the Sportivo on the lane designated for provincial buses. As Acosta reached out to take Libunaos license, the driver closed the window of the vehicle and drove off, dragging the enforcer for several meters before running over him. Were not sure what happened after that. His fellow MMDA traffic enforcers just saw him lying on the ground with blood all over him, his wife, Richelle, told the police. RELATED STORIES",Maricar B.

2014-12-23,,dies:1,," MANILA - The traffic constable of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) who was run over by a sports utility vehicle (SUV) he had flagged down has passed away. MMDA chairman Francis Tolentino and general manager Corazon Jimenez confirmed the news. They said traffic constable Sonny Acosta died due to cardiac arrest at around 2 p.m. Tuesday at the St. Luke's Medical Center in Quezon City. Acosta sustained after he was dragged and run over by an Isuzu Sportivo in Cubao, Quezon City last Friday. Tolentino had said the SUV, owned by Dante Borguete of San Miguel, Bulacan and driven by Mark Ian Libunao, was on the wrong lane and was thus flagged down by Acosta. But instead of stopping, the SUV allegedly sped off, hitting the traffic constable and then dragged him for several meters. ""Itong pulang Sportivo ay wala sa lane, sa mga bus sumasama. Pinahinto siya. Kunwari ibibigay yung lisensiya tapos sinara bigla yung bintana, automatic siguro yun, pinatakbo. Kinaladkad, napailalim [si Acosta],"" Tolentino said. In a statement on Tuesday, the MMDA chief said: ""We are saddened by the demise of...Acosta who was mercilessly hit and dragged by a motorist while performing his traffic duties along EDSA. This pattern of wanton disregard for traffic laws and persons in authority should be halted collectively by our society - respect for each other should be the norm."" He said they will continue to assist the family of Acosta in seeking justice for his death. The hospital expenses of Acosta were shouldered by the MMDA. All legal expenses against the driver of the SUV are also being shouldered by the MMDA. Tolentino, meanwhile, called on witnesses ""to appear and support the quest for justice amidst alleged attempts to mislead the path of the case."" ""This should be the last case of this nature.

2014-12-23,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesThe Department of Transportation and Communications drew two offers for its first transportation hub public private partnership (PPP) deal to be located in southern Metro Manila even as most of the potential bidders snubbed the P2.5-billion project. Transportation department spokesperson Michael Sagcal said the two companies that submitted offers for the Integrated Transport System-Southwest PPP were MWM Terminals, led by Megawide Construction Corp., and Gotianun-led Filinvest Land Inc. The two were among 16 companies, including conglomerates San Miguel Corp., Ayala Corp. and Megaworld Corp., that acquired bid documents but did not submit any offers on the Dec. 22 deadline. The project, which was rolled out in December 2013 but has suffered several delays, is being implemented using a single-stage process. This means qualification, technical and financial proposals are submitted at one time and will be evaluated within the next two months. A dual-stage structure means these are submitted and evaluated separately. Although we would have preferred to have more groups participating in the bid, we are nevertheless satisfied to have two established and reputable companies competing for the project, Sagcal said. For Megawide, the PPP deal, which is the first of three ITS projects in the pipeline, would allow the company mainly to expand its construction portfolio and diversify its business, according to Megawide chief marketing officer Louie Ferrer. The ITS was meant to create intermodal hubs where provincial buses would disembark passengers to transfer to other in-city modes of transport such as elevated railways, city buses and UV Express vans. The move was aimed at easing congestion within Metro Manila. Ferrer noted that Megawide is partnering with Walter Mart, a retail group led by the Sy family of SM Investments Corp., for its ITS venture. Meanwhile, large conglomerates such as Ayala said the ITS-Southwest lacked the necessary size to justify an investment.",,"2:06 AM | Tuesday, December 23rd, 2014",,yes,2014-12-23 00:00:00,"road infrastructure repair,maintenance",,,,,,,,english,,http://business.inquirer.net/183925/2-firms-bid-for-transport-hub-ppp,,"san miguel, metro manila, manila",text,,725.0,,908.0,,pia,,,"vehicle safety and maintenance, road infrastructure",4.5,Straight News,,,,,"improvement of road infrastructure, improvement of mass public transport infrastructure",inquirer,no,,,,,2 firms bid for transport hub PPP | Inquirer Business,,,

MMDA Traffic Constable Sonny Acosta just died. He has returned to the heavenly arms of our Lord where justice and eternal peace reign, the MMDA said. Acosta died around 2:30 p.m. due to cardiac arrest, a radio report quoted MMDA Chairman Francis Tolentino as saying. On December 19, the traffic constable flagged down an Isuzu Sportivo for being in the lane designated for provincial buses in Cubao, Quezon City. When Acosta asked for the motorists license, the driver, identified as Mark Ian Libunao, supposedly rolled up his window and sped off even while Acostas hand was stuck in the cars window. Acostas fellow MMDA enforcers found him bloody on the ground. He had been in critical condition at St. Lukes Medical Center in Quezon City before he succumbed to head injuries, the dzMM radio report said. Tolentino said the MMDA paid for all the hospital expenses of Acosta. Libunao was arrested on charges of reckless imprudence resulting in serious physical injuries and driving with an expired license. Libunao denied the allegations against him, demanding a closed circuit television (CCTV) footage of the incident. Acosta, who has three daughters, was the familys sole breadwinner.

2014-12-24,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesWhile environmentally safe, the use and deployment of electric jeepneys all over the Philippines must be based on a sound traffic management plan, Sen. Pia Cayetano said on Tuesday. Cayetano, in a recent hearing on sustainable transportation, said bringing in electric jeepneys must not be based solely on the fact that it would pose hardly any threat to the environment. Of course, I want something environmentally friendly, but environmentally friendly alone does not necessarily tackle other issues like traffic management, she said at last weeks hearing. Were so proud that e-jeeps are environmentally friendly that we let cities get 20 or 100 of them. But those are still more rolling vehicles on the road that cannot afford to have a single extra vehicle, Cayetano said. She noted that not all of the electric jeepneys in the country were covered by franchises. Rolling out electric jeepneys must be part of a comprehensive plan that would take into consideration how big the vehicles should be and how many could be deployed, she said. The lack of planning has been very frustrating, she added. Cayetano said she had been a supporter of the electric jeepney, earlier calling on the government to grant franchises to e-jeep operators. But she had assumed, she said, that the Department of Transportation and Communications (DoTC) had been doing a study to determine whether there was a need for additional vehicles on the road. Cayetano also pointed out that most of the electric jeepneys in the country were imported, even if the Philippines has been operating for decades a jeepney building industry. The jeepney is a Philippine innovation that has become a big part of the countrys cultural heritage, and it must not be overshadowed by imports, according to Cayetano. I dont find it acceptable that one group is rolling out e-jeeps that are imported and we have a local jeepney industry. Sustainability means providing jobs. And thats also where one advocacy of mine comes in. Thats our heritage, thats our culture, this jeepney culture, she said. Instead of replacing the local jeepneys with foreign-made ones, the government must step in to transform them into a more sustainable form of public transportation, she said. Assistant Transportation Secretary Sherielysse Bonifacio said during last weeks hearing that the DoTCs National Implementation Plan was focused focused not only on environmentally friendly forms of transportation, but also on sustainable ones. Bonifacio said the goal would be to provide accessible, affordable, safe, resilient, and sustainable transport systems. She said this was the goal of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) and an Asean commitment to which the Philippines adhered. As for electric jeepneys, the DoTC has no policy yet, but it entertains every application, according to Bonifacio. The DoTC official pushed for an origin-destination study to determine if there were enough public vehicles. This study, she said, has not been done since 1996 and ideally, it should be done every five years. The Metro Manila study, however, has been going through updating by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (Jica) and the results would be out next November, she said. Bonifacio said Transportation Secretary Joseph Abaya has been looking for a scientific way to award franchises for public vehicles. At present, the issuance of franchises, which has been based on public demand in a particular transport corridor, is very subjective, she said. RELATED STORIES",Leila B.

2014-12-24,,,Government agencies,"MANILA  The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) will review its protocols in apprehending erring motorists to prevent other incidents similar to the case of traffic constable Sonny Acosta, who died after sustaining severe head injuries after being dragged and run over by a vehicle. MMDA Chairman Francis Tolentino said the agency will not only revisit apprehension procedures, it will also call for a review on procedures when applying for a drivers license and when purchasing vehicles. Tolentino said the process of buying a car should be similar to that of buying a firearm, which involves several steps and assessments. There has to be a greater review on how we issue licenses, how we allow the easy purchases of motor vehicles. [It should be] similar to the manner which we acquire firearms, which is very stringent, requiring psychological examinations. This case elevates to the societal arena the real need for showing mutual respect not just to traffic enforcers and motorists, but to the law, he told ANC on Wednesday. Acosta died on Tuesday due to cardiac arrest at the St. Luke's Medical Center in Quezon City. He had been confined in the hospital since Friday after being run over by an SUV, driven by Mark Ian Libunao. According to Tolentino, Libunao was driving on the wrong lane and was flagged down by Acosta. But instead of stopping, the SUV allegedly sped off, hitting the traffic constable and then dragged him for several meters. Tolentino expressed sadness over Acostas death, urging motorists to show respect to traffic enforcers. If you look at closely at this Acosta case, when he flagged down the erring driver, he even saluted and greeted good morning, so it just shows that this guy is really a courteous traffic enforcer, he said. Tolentino admitted that there are some reports of disrespectful traffic enforcers, but noted that there have been no incidents as such that resulted to a death of a motorist. Tolentino said the MMDA will continue to provide legal and financial assistance to the family of Acosta. He said that the agency is considering seeking employment opportunities for Acostas wife as well as scholarship grants for Acostas eldest daughter, who is in college.",,ABS-CBNnews.com,Metropolitan Manila Development Authority,yes,2014-12-24 00:00:00,enforcement of existing lawsordinances,,,,,,,,english,,http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/12/24/14/mmda-review-apprehension-policy,,"quezon city, quezon, manila",text,,399.0,,303.0,,candice,,,traffic enforcement and violations,5.5,Straight News,,,,,improvement of traffic enforcement,abs-cbnnews,no,no,,,,MMDA to review apprehension policy,Neutral,,

2014-12-24,,,,"Although its been said many times, many ways, Merry Christmas to everyone! * * * The Department of Transportation and Communications under Secretary Joseph Emilio Abaya has a strange Christmas and New Year gift to the riding public: Starting next year, commuters will have to pay almost double in fares to be able to ride the packed MRT and LRT elevated trains. This is not only a cruel joke; it also adds insult to injury. Think of it: Commuters will have to pay almost twice what they are paying now just to fall in long lines extending from the platforms, down the stairs and on to the sidewalks and streets for at least half an hour, then jostle for cramped space in the crowded trains that often break down and expose them to death or injury. What a way to meet the New Year, no thanks to Mr. Abaya and the DOTC. It is ironic that the fare increases come right after a report that the MRT 3 train system is so badly maintained that many parts of the rails are broken, exposing the trains to possible derailment and the passengers to the risk of death or injury. This has actually happened a number of times. But instead of replacing the broken rails and fixing the glitches in the system, the DOTC is fixing the problems by raising passenger fares. It is as if the DOTC wants commuters to stop riding the trains and relieve the pressure on the MRT management. The fare increases will not be so painful if they are imposed after the train system is improved. But no, the DOTC says: Pay up first, improvement later. Its press releases seem to fix the blame on the private owners. Wrong. False. The trains may still be privately owned (by MRT Holdings), but they are being operated by the DOTC and maintained by a provider that the DOTC has hired. In fact, the DOTC wants to take full ownership of the train system. The government has ordered two government banks to buy shares of stocks of MRT Holdings. The corporation is now majority-controlled by the DOTC. But note that MRT3s problems began when the DOTC took over its operation, dismissed its maintenance provider, Sumitomo of Japan, and hired a new one (the reason is not clear, but we can guess). Thats when the breakdowns started. The DOTC delayed buying new trains although the system badly needed more trains and the old ones are already rundown and dilapidated. The MRT manager was even accused by a foreign ambassador of trying to extort a multimillion-peso bribe in exchange for the purchase of trains from his country. When the scandal broke out, the manager resigned (or was dismissed). The government claims it is paying billions of pesos to subsidize the train operations. The administrations mantra is: Why should taxpayers of the Visayas and Mindanao pay for the operation of a train system that only Metro Manilans use? It forgets that Metro Manilans and other taxpayers also pay for aid to the Visayas and Mindanao during disasters. It forgets that Metro Manila pays the bulk of all taxes paidand that mass transportation is meant to be subsidized by governments. All over the world, trains are subsidized by governments because they are the cheapest means of mass transportation of people and cargo. It is one way for a government to return to the people the taxes they pay. In the United States, Europe, India, China, Japan and other countries, taxpayers subsidize the trains that transport the biggest number of people and cargo. Our Philippine National Railways should have been supported the same way, but a succession of presidents beginning with Ferdinand Marcos neglected it and reduced subsidies. The PNR trains and rails have deteriorated, and are now reduced to a fraction of what they used to be. Trains used to run the whole length of Luzon from San Fernando in La Union to Legazpi in Albay. Now the infrequent trains run only from Manila to Quezon. Much of the rails have been stolen; the railroad right of way has been occupied by squatters. The Arroyo administration tried to revive it with the North Rail project, but that was derailed by accusations of graft and corruption. Other big islands used to have train systems, too. Now they are all gone. Yet many of the transportation problems of Metro Manila and the whole country can be alleviated by trains. The traffic jams in the metropolis can be eased with more commuter trains. The highways can be relieved of heavy traffic if there are more trains to transport people and cargo. The port and traffic congestion caused by giant delivery trucks in Metro Manila going to and from the ports can be eased by the railroad. There are railroad tracks going through Caloocan to Tutuban to the piers. Flatcars used to transport cargo from the piers to Caloocan and from there to north and south Luzon. There is actually no need for giant truck trailers to go through the narrow streets of the metropolis. Merely by relocating the squatters and reclaiming the railroad tracks, these can be used again to ease the port congestion. But our officials are either shortsighted or afraid of squatters, which is why they are not doing any such thing. The next president should pay attention to this pressing problem.",Neal H.

Superintendent Edcille Canals, Lopez police station chief, said at 11:55 p.m. of Dec. 24, Luis Centenera, 37, was traveling along the Maharlika Highway in Barangay Jongo aboard a Mitsubishi Adventure (EBS-940) when he hit two tricycles in a row. A passenger of one of the tricycles, Gertrudes Batanes, was thrown out of the vehicle upon impact and was consequently ran over by Centeneras car, said Canals. Batanes was declared dead on arrival at the hospital, Canals said. After the collision, Centenera tried to escape and subsequently hit five other vehicles along the way that included two more tricycles and three sport utility vehicles. A Lopez mobile patrol vehicle gave chase until the escaping Centenera was stopped in a road barricade set up by policemen in the nearby town of Gumaca. All in all, ten other persons, passengers and drivers of seven vehicles, sustained various degrees of injuries, police report said. During investigation, Centeneras teenage son who was traveling with his father told policemen that he had been trying to stop his father after the latter also got involved in a prior accident in Calauag town.

2014-12-26,,hurt:7,Vehicle users,"Seven people, including a 12-year-old boy, ended up in the hospital on Christmas Day after they figured in a multiple collision involving 11 vehicles in Paraaque City. Traffic investigator SPO1 Reynaldo Serafica said that the accident was caused by the driver of a public utility jeepney (Isuzu minivan with plate number TEX 348) who lost control of his vehicle because he was believed to be speeding. The suspect has yet to be identified because he escaped right after the incident which happened at 7 a.m. at the intersection of MIA Road and Emilio Aguinaldo Highway or Coastal Road in Barangay (village) Tambo. We have to check under whose name the minivan was registered when offices resume so we can figure out [his identity], Serafica said. According to a police report, the PUJ which came from Cavite was plying the northbound lane of E. Aguinaldo Highway to drop off passengers in Baclaran when it hit the vehicles ahead of ita Toyota Vios with plate number UVU 915 driven by Rodrigo Sabio, a Toyota pickup with plate number NOR 972 driven by Diolito Pinon, a Toyota Hiace commuter van with plate number AAK 2030 driven by Cornelio Bulado Jr., and a Toyota Corolla with plate number UPN 821 driven by Doroteo Cabalejo Jr. The four vehicles were waiting for the traffic light to turn green so that they could cross the intersection when the jeepney slammed into them. According to witnesses, the [jeepney] driver was going fast. If he had a brake he would have braked but he didnt or he couldnt. Instead, he swerved to the left to try to avoid the vehicles in front of him but he hit [them anyway], Serafica said. After hitting the four vehicles in front of it, the jeepney went on to hit a Kia Besta, with plate number USU-518 driven by Bernardo Royales, causing a domino effect involving a Rusi QB100 motorcycle with no plate number driven by Nilo Castaneda, a Nissan Sentra with plate number TRZ 858 driven by Joel Pascual, a Toyota Vios with plate number UWC 518 driven by Felix Tampos, and a Ford Everest with plate number TIB 559 driven by Rodolfo Lubrin Jr. Serafica said that Cabalejos car, which was closest to the intersection, was hit so forcefully that it crossed over to the southbound lane and hit another jeepney (plate number DWF 984) driven by Ronaldo Co. Injured in the accident were Ramil Tapia, 46; Lolita Castro, 66; Marissa Aliling, 41; John Paul Edrian Aliling, 12; Wilfredo R. Contemplo, 62; Pascual, 57; and Cabalejo, 41.

2014-12-28,,,Vehicle users,"MANILA, PhilippinesWith the death of a traffic enforcer who got dragged and run over by a sport utility vehicle driver along Edsa-Cubao last week, Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) Chair Francis Tolentino encouraged every motorist to show respect not only to traffic constables but also to pedestrians, fellow drivers and passengers as well. During the cremation of the remains of traffic constable Sonny Acosta on Sunday in Malabon, Tolentino made the call as he noted that responsible citizens like Acosta have become helpless victims of traffic crimes and reckless driving even if they were just doing their jobs. One lesson that we can get from this incident is the aspect of respect. The respect we need to give to every driver on the road, to private motorists and even to traffic rules and people in authority, Tolentino said during the agencys weekly radio program. The 38-year-old Acosta died on Tuesday because of traumatic brain injuries and after being in coma for four days at the St. Lukes Medical Center in Quezon City, leaving behind his wife and three daughters, the youngest of which is only six months old. The traffic enforcer got his hand trapped on the window of the car that dragged him a few meters along Edsa on Dec. 19 before he was run over by the vehicle that he had tried to flag down for using the lane designated for buses in Cubao. The Quezon City police earlier expressed its plan to upgrade to homicide the case filed against Isuzu Sportivo driver Mark Ian Libunao. The police and the MMDA initially filed charges of reckless imprudence resulting in serious physical injuries and driving with an expired license against the 35-year-old Libunao. Tolentino said that this case should be an eye-opener to all motorists and should encourage them to respect everyone on the streets. The MMDA chair also slammed Libunao for continually denying his role in the killing despite being identified by witnesses and being linked to the vehicle that ran over Acosta. He showed no respect for traffic regulations when he used the lane for provincial buses and he also disrespected the traffic enforcer who courteously told him about his violation and asked for his license, Tolentino added. On Sunday morning, Acostas family and friends said their last goodbye to the traffic enforcer before his remains were cremated at the Floresco Funeral Homes in Malabon. The MMDA said that Acostas ashes would be temporarily kept by the family before deciding on the place of interment. Aside from helping Acostas family shoulder the hospital expenses, Tolentino also promised to give educational assistance to the three daughters of the traffic constable.",Maricar B.

The truck, driven by one Hilario Bragas, was on its way to deliver Styrofoam food containers when its back end was hit by the SUV. Bragas said he was set to start moving again after stopping due to a red light when the accident occurred. ""Biglang kumalabog ng malakas,"" said Bragas. ""Pati nga ako napa-atras sa inuupuan ko."" The front end of the SUV, with plate number ZCX 307, slid into the back end of the truck. The SUV's airbag opened up and the driver's right knee was pinned inside the vehicle.

2014-12-29,,hurt:1,Vehicle users,"Another traffic constable of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) was injured on the job even as the agencys chief appealed to motorists to show more respect to MMDA personnel, who of late have been falling victim to road rage or reckless driving, including one that turned fatal last week. The police said Roger Borres, 28, suffered bruises after the motorbike he was driving got bumped from behind by a Jayross passenger bus driven by Ferryzaldo Bansuela, 41, at 6:35 p.m. Friday on the northbound lane of Edsa in Cubao, Quezon City. Borres, who was then on duty, was brought to East Avenue Medical Center for treatment, while Bansuela was taken into custody by the Quezon City Police District (QCPD). But according to QCPD-Traffic Enforcement Unit chief Superintendent Ely Pintang, no criminal charges were filed against Bansuela as Borres agreed to a settlement and accepted payment for the damage to the motorcycle. The incident was considered an accident, Pintang said on Saturday, noting that the bus driver was in a hurry. Still, Pintang noted that it was a close call coming on the heels of a road encounter also on Edsa that killed one of Borres colleagues, Sonny Acosta, who was dragged by the vehicle he had flagged down for a lane violation on Dec. 19. Acosta, whose hand got caught in the vehicles window as the motorist sped off and ran over him in the process, suffered severe injuries and lay comatose in the hospital until he died five days later. The police on Dec. 20 arrested Mark Ian Libunao, the alleged driver of the Isuzu Sportivo in the hit-and-run incident, and initially charged him with reckless imprudence resulting in physical injuries, which may soon be upgraded to homicide now that the victim had died. They also cited Libunao, a 32-year-old family driver from San Miguel, Bulacan province, for driving with an expired license. Acostas remains were cremated Sunday morning at Floresco Funeral Homes in Malabon City. On his weekly radio program, MMDA Chair Francis Tolentino cited Acostas death in appealing to motorists to regard civilian traffic officers like him with more respect. One lesson that we can get from this incident is the aspect of respect, the respect we need to give people in authority, said Tolentino, who also assailed Libunao for continuously denying he was the motorist flagged down by Acosta despite being identified by witnesses. He (Libunao) showed no respect for traffic regulations when he used the lane for provincial buses and he also disrespected the traffic enforcer who courteously told him about his violation and asked for his license, the official stressed. Aside from helping Acostas family pay the hospital bills, Tolentino said the MMDA would also extend educational assistance to the three daughters the traffic constable had left behind.",,", | 2:15 AM | Monday, December 29th, 2014","Philippine National Police, Metropolitan Manila Development Authority",yes,2014-12-29 00:00:00,road crashes,,2.0,1.0,name: Roger Borres; age: 28; gender: male; profession: MMDA traffic aide; ridergroup: motorcycle rider; natureofinjury: suffered bruises after being bumped by bus from behind /,,,,english,yes,http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/660218/another-mmda-traffic-aide-hurt-in-close-call-on-edsa,"NCR, Quezon City, EDSA Cubao","malabon, quezon, bulacan, quezon city, manila",text,#acostaMMDA,53.0,,407.0,speeding,mavie,,driver related,road crash incident,7.5,Straight News,,,,,road user education,inquirer,yes,no,,,6:35 PM,Another MMDA traffic aide hurt in close call on Edsa | Inquirer News,Neutral,"Government use vehicle, Public utility vehicle","motorcycle, bus"
2014-12-29,,death:1,,"MANILA, Philippines - The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) will upgrade today the charge filed against a motorist who dragged a traffic enforcer along EDSA in Quezon City, MMDA Chairman Francis Tolentino said yesterday. The homicide charge against Mark Ian Libunao will be upgraded to murder, he said. Libunao, who denied the allegations against him, was charged with reckless imprudence resulting in serious physical injuries and driving with an expired drivers license. The city prosecutor set bail at P8,000. Tolentino said murder, however, is a non-bailable offense. Constable Sonny Acostas remains were cremated at the Floresco Heritage Memorial Chapel in Malabon City yesterday after his family and friends paid their last respects. Acosta died four days after he was dragged and run over by a vehicle whose driver he had flagged down for a traffic violation on Dec. 19. Tolentino earlier said Libunao may be a fall guy since witnesses claimed to have seen an older man driving the vehicle. Reports said Acostas arm was trapped when the motorist closed the window. The enforcer ended up being dragged and run over as the driver sped away. Acostas death stems from a lack of respect for traffic rules and the ones who enforce them, Tolentino said.

2014-12-29,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesThe overwhelming number of vehicles caused the massive traffic jams along highways leading to popular vacation spots, like Baguio and other parts of northern Luzon in recent days, a toll road official said on Sunday. Toll roads like North Luzon Expressway (NLEx), Subic-Clark-Tarlac Expressway (SCTEx) and the Tarlac-Pangasinan-La Union Expressway (TPLEx) saw heavy vehicular traffic, especially on Dec. 26, reports said. It was really just our capacity being overwhelmed by the volume of vehicles, Rodrigo Franco, president of NLEx operator Manila North Tollways Corp, said in an interview. The NLEx typically handles more than 180,000 vehicles per day and the figure shoots up to about 220,000 vehicles during the peak of the Christmas holidays. But on Dec. 26, preliminary data showed that volume hitting 252,000 vehicles, Franco said. Traffic really went beyond what we normally get during that time, Franco said, adding that the buildup happened at the tollbooths. He said most of the congestion was felt at the Dau tollbooth in Pampanga province. Franco was speaking for the company led by businessman Manuel V. Pangilinan, which operates both NLEx and SCTEx. San Miguel Corp, the main group behind TPLEx, said it might issue a statement Monday, a company spokesperson said. The management of TPLEx recently opened the 13.66-kilometer Rosales-Urdaneta stretch in Pangasinan province. It said this was available to motorists starting Dec. 20 to Jan. 20, 2015, to ease traffic flow to and from northern Luzon during the holidays. Private Infra Development Corp. (PIDC), a unit of diversified San Miguel Corp. and operator of the TPLEx, said the use of the new section would be free of charge during the period. In 2013, the company opened the first section (Tarlac City to Paniqui) of the total 88-km TPLEx project for motorists free use during the Christmas season. It then soft-opened the Paniqui-Rosales section in time for the Holy Week in April. With the opening of the new section, the total length of the TPLEx that has been made operational in just over a year, will reach 63 kilometers, according to PIDC. It expects to fully complete the project, running to Rosario town, La Union province, in 2015.",Miguel R.

2014-12-29,,,,"MANILA, PhilippinesAfter spending 11-and-a-half hours on the road to Baguio City, Senate President Franklin Drilon is seeking a Senate inquiry into the inefficiencies of the toll collection system at the expressways, which he said exacerbated the traffic situation. The operator of two expressway networks attributed the traffic congestion to the huge number of vehicles going to Baguio and other popular vacation spots in northern Luzon. North Luzon Expressway (NLEx), Subic-Clark-Tarlac Expressway (SCTEx) and Cavitex, meanwhile, are issuing advisories to motorists to stagger their journey back to Metro Manila on Jan. 1-4, to avoid heavy congestion at the tollbooths. Drilon, speaking over dzBB radio, blamed the lengthy road trip to the City of Pines on the need to stop at several tollgates along the way, because different entities handle the collection of fees. He proposed that the collection of fees be integrated so that only one entity would handle the matter. The expressways going to the north are NLEx, SCTEx and Tarlac-Pangasinan-La Union Expressway (TPLEx). The three are contiguous. TPLEx is an extension of SCTEx, which in turn is connected to NLEx. Drilon acknowledged that there were a lot of people traveling to northern Luzon for the holidays and were probably induced to do so by low gas prices. But the need to stop to pay the toll several times exacerbates the traffic situation and leads to the extraordinary traffic buildup at the tollgates, he said. Its an expressway, but when you get to the tollgate it becomes a barangay road, he said in a separate phone interview. He recalled that it took him one hour to traverse a 2-kilometer stretch leading to one tollbooth. The volume was aggravated by the inefficiencies of the system, he added. Aside from the kilometric lines leading to the tollgates, there were gates that were too narrow and had too few collection booths. And despite the long line of vehicles, there was nobody collecting toll payments in advance, he noted. There were also times when the cashiers at the booths did not have enough change, leading to further delays as they scramble to get the necessary amount, he said. According to Drilon, integrating the payment system for the toll collection would not be a complex task. I cant understand why the collection of toll fees cant be integrated, so that only one entity handles the collection, he said. Its not rocket science, he added. If this would be implemented, travelers would need to make fewer stops, he said. Such a move would benefit both private and public utility vehicles, he pointed out. Spending funds to build larger tollgates would also be money well spent, as it would allow more vehicles to pass through at one time, he further said. According to Drilon, his nearly half-day trip on Dec. 26 was the longest ride to Baguio that he had experienced. He left San Juan City in Metro Manila at 7 a.m. and arrived in the summer capital at 6:30 p.m. In contrast, it took him three and a half hours to return from Baguio to Manila Sunday. He left at 5:30 a.m. and was in Metro Manila before 9:30 a.m. After the holidays, Drilon intends to file a resolution so that the Senate could look into the problems that commuters and motorists face when using the expressways. Something must be done about this, he said. RELATED STORIES",Leila B.

2014-12-30,,,,"MANILA, Philippines - The government will work for a more orderly exodus of travelers from Metro Manila for the New Year, especially after the problems at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) Terminal 3 and the traffic congestion on expressways, Malacaang said yesterday. Transportation Secretary Joseph Emilio Abaya disclosed that President Aquino called to ask him what happened at NAIA 3, presidential spokesman Edwin Lacierda said in a press briefing. Lacierda said the President inquired about the reports of unmanned counters, delayed flights and overbooking. He also said Abaya would be meeting with Toll Regulatory Board (TRB) executive director Edmund Reyes on the first week of January because there are technological solutions to the problems on the North Luzon Expressway (NLEX) and South Luzon Expressway (SLEX). He said the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) chief was studying everything to avoid the situations that occurred on Christmas Day and on Dec. 26. Lacierda added they could understand the complaints and the grievances of passengers, especially of Cebu Pacific because its a time to go home and be with your loved ones. He said this was the reason why an investigation was launched by various agencies on the issues involving the budget airline. In a television interview, Abaya said he is not satisfied with the explanation of Cebu Pacific (Cebu Air, Inc.) on the nightmare experienced by passengers during the Christmas rush. Cebu Pacific should have prepared a contingency plan to accommodate and address the needs of passengers especially during the holiday season, he said. He added that the failure of the staff of Cebu Pacific due to alleged fatigue is not an acceptable reason. Abaya pointed out that the DOTC has tasked the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) to look into the possible revision of the Civil Aeronautics Act, as well as the Air Passenger Bill of Rights, to protect the riding public. Bayan Muna party-list Rep. Neri Colmenares meanwhile said yesterday that the House of Representatives should investigate the CAB for failing to protect airline passengers. CAB should not be allowed to escape accountability since dismal airline service has been going on for a long time, Colmenares said. For his part, CAB executive director Carmelo Arcilla said a panel has been formed to look into the liability of Cebu Pacific amid the rising number of complaints from passengers. Passengers were up in arms particularly last Dec. 24 due to the long queues as well as the delays and cancellations of several Cebu Pacific flights. The low-cost carrier is facing at least 14 complaints from its passengers. Arcilla said the panel composed of CAB, the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) and the Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) would convene early January to look into the documents and reports to be submitted by Cebu Pacific. Jose Angel Honrado, MIAA general manager, said initial investigation showed that 142 flights were delayed last Dec. 24, a hundred of which belonged to Cebu Pacific. Honrado also observed that the check-in counters of Cebu Pacific were undermanned, resulting in long queues. According to him, the regulator is not buying the excuse of Cebu Pacific that the delays and flight cancellations were caused by air traffic congestion and bad weather. The CAB is looking at disallowing overbooking during peak seasons, such as during the Christmas holidays, to avoid the bumping off of passengers. Present rules allow airlines to overbook 10 percent of total seats to serve as buffer in case passengers fail to show up on time. Cebu Pacific vice president for corporate affairs Jorenz Taada earlier said that the airline would cooperate with any investigation to be undertaken by the government. The Gokongwei-led airline flew 13.94 million passengers in the first 10 months of the year, or 15.7 percent higher compared to the 12.04 million passengers in the same period last year. Aside from the long queues, delayed flights and overbooking, Colmenares said that the congressional investigation would also look into issues of cancelled flights; expensive rebooking fees and penalties, although upon cancellation or changing of flight schedules by the airline management, no penalties or refund are given to the passengers; and deceptively low initial base fare offers that shoot up due to big tax amounts and surcharges. Also, airlines in many instances do not use the passenger tube even if the passengers have paid for its use, making it difficult for the elderly and the sick as they would have to go down the tarmac, he said.

2014-12-30,,,,"BAGUIO CITYThe big chill has returned to the summer capital, with Tuesday mornings temperature down to 11.8 degrees Celsius. Benedicto Alhambra, Baguio City tourism officer, said this is a welcome start of chilly mornings which residents and visitors pine for each time the year ends. Alhambra said Baguios climate was the best reason for tourists to frequent the mountain city. The coldest temperature in Baguio was recorded on Jan. 18, 1961 when the temperature plunged to 6.3 degrees Celsius. This month, the mercury dropped to 12 degrees Celsius on Dec. 17 and 18, but temperatures rose slightly to 16 degrees and 15.6 degrees on Christmas eve and Christmas day, respectively. The city started to cool down further when temperatures dropped to 15 degrees on Dec. 26; 14 degrees on Dec. 27; 13.6 degrees on Dec. 28; and 13 degrees on Monday. Wilson Lucando, Baguio weather observer, said this weather pattern will continue until February due to the cold front. But while the local tourism industry draws its best revenues yet since Dec. 1 because of the nippy weather, the city government is anticipating a potential backlash from Christmas holiday visitors whose travel was spoiled last week by traffic jams stretching from the outskirts of Metro Manila to La Union province. Gasoline prices were down so more people used their cars to travel to Baguio, Alhambra said. He said contractors also opened a portion of the Tarlac-Pangasinan-La Union Expressway (TPLEx) which was designed to reduce travel time to Baguio to at least four hours when it is completed. As a result, Alhambra said, the city government was unprepared for the volume of visitors who motored to Baguio from Dec. 24 to 26, many of whom were already frustrated by the crawling traffic on TPLEx, the Subic-Clark-Tarlac Expressway (SCTEx) and the North Luzon Expressway (NLEx) during that period. Baguio has received some bad reviews online and on social media, he said, because weary tourists had to confront the same traffic problems here, on top of difficulties finding places to stay because all hotels and inns were booked since the start of December. In January, after the New Year holiday break, the city government will gather various agencies and the private sector to hammer out solutions before the citys next crowd-drawing event, the annual Baguio Flower Festival, in February and the Holy Week break, Alhambra said. Given the citys narrow roads and the absence of wide parking spaces, Baguio hotels need to provide shuttle services for their visitors to encourage them to leave their vehicles at the establishments, he said. We also need to resolve the problem of parking. We have new hotels being built but we need to enforce regulations which require them to allot appropriate parking spaces according to the number of their projected occupants, he said. We need to unclog side streets so these could be part of the traffic flow instead of their current role as staging area for public utility vehicles. Alhambra said the citys tourist arrivals this month were double the record set in the same period last year. This meant an estimated increase to 215,462 visitors from 107,731 visitors in December 2013. The 2013 Baguio Tourism Arrivals report given by the city tourism office showed that 843,473 tourists visited the city last year.
